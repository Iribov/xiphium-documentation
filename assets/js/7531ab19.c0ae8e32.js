Usually, an order is a client asking \"I would like x amount of product y\". But because of the inherent complexity in Tissue Culture planning/production, we need to know when the client needs the plants. That way, we can 'reverse calculate' when we should start production to achieve the amount of plants ordered. Therefore, the 'week request' is used (the week of when the client requested to receive the plants). After making the planning, we can enter our planned week of delivery in 'week prognose' and the probably possible amount of plants to deliver in 'plants prognose'."]}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:"This is the basis of an order.
