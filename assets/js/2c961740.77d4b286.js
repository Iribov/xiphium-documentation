This is a test for now, and the old connections are left untouched. There will be a point in the future where we will replace all connection from Treatment to Experiment to go via the Treatment_Summary table.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Treatment_Conversion_Method*** was added to fill the Treatment_Summary table using the data from the Treatment Table. The Treatment records are also immediatly connected to their new Treatment_Summary record.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliveries \\r\\nMethod ***DeN_Print_BoxLabel*** now has a progress bar.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Export_PackingListExpress*** now exports the picture in a different size.\\r\\n\\r\\nbutton \\"DiT_Button_BoxLabel15\\" has been added to form [DeliveryNote]\\"DeN_Detail\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n2 new forms have been added called [DeliveryNote]\\"DeN_Print_BoxLabel_no_plantname\\" and [DeliveryNote]\\"DeN_Print_CMR_LogisticsNL\\".\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Planning\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** now ignores internal deliveries. This was especially a problem with combined Greenhouse_Field records (combining still poses a problem in other areas). Also, a rule has been implemented that a delivery action is only even \\"Done\\" when there are no longer plants present in the greenhouse, and the status is directly set to \\"Finished\\". Partial deliveries are not planned!\\r\\n\\r\\nForm \\"GHPA_Overview\\" has been improved after user feedback. There is now a popup when modifying protocolcodes in a batch (using the button), and you are able to clear the manual protocolcode as expected using the \'empty\' checkbox.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Misc\\r\\n\\r\\n### Plugin Register Keys\\r\\nMethod ***App_OnStartup*** has been modified. It seems that all register keys for plugins have been updated. The OS seperated register keys for the plugin \\"xlBook\\" are now merged into one call. This gives an error on my windows machine.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nis it useful to have these register keys hard-coded anyway? Shouldn\'t they be in some separate file on the server?\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### groupBy\\r\\nMethod ***groupBy*** and its subsequent methods ***GroupbyConvertGroups*** and ***GroupbyAggregateGroups*** have been improved and refactored. The method now correctly handles aggregations when a collection is passed (used to only work for EntitySelections).\\r\\n\\r\\n### TCB\\r\\nLots of work is done to multiple methods that have to with the TC Planning visualization (methods starting with TCB). Most (if not all) of the empty methods added last week are now filled with code."},{"id":"/2025/01/10/Xiphium-W02-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/10/Xiphium-W02-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2025-01-10-Xiphium-W02-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-10-Xiphium-W02-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2025-W02 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 10, 2025","tags":[],"readingTime":2.455,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W02 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W03 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/16/Xiphium-W03-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W01 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/03/Xiphium-W01-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\n\\n:::warning\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.

These name change deletions will be ignored in this weeks blog.\\n\\nMany methods are also adjusted to adhere to the new table naming. Most notably methods using ORDA, the local variables still used the old naming scheme and most are now replaced.\\n:::\\n\\n## Login\\nA CapsLock warning is implemented in the login screen.\\n\\n## Plant\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/Pla_Colorfield_List.4dm has been modified to not color the \'Date In\' anymore.\\n### Plant Menu\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/Access_SetupPlantsMenu.4dm has been modified. 2 new input forms have been added called \'Period2\' & \'Admin\'. 3 existing Output forms have been renamed:\\n1. Protocol4 -> Protocol Stock\\n2. \\\\- -> Check\\n3. Admin -> Period1\\n\\n\\n## Tax Group\\nMethods Project/Sources/Methods/DeN_CreateInvoice_DiT.4dm, Method Project/Sources/Methods/GF_CreateInvoice_WBP.4dm, Project/Sources/Methods/Ord_CreateBatchInvoice.4dm and Project/Sources/Methods/Ord_CreateBatchInvoiceNPlants.4dm have been modified to change tax group company \\"1\\" from tax group \\"L\\" to \\"H\\", whatever that may mean.\\n\\n has been modified to change tax group company \\"1\\" from tax group \\"L\\" to \\"H\\", whatever that may mean\\n\\n## GHPA\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/GHPA_Excel_Export.4dm has been modified to exclude floating actions.\\n\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF.4dm has been modified to get the plants present form Greenhouse_Field for Moving Actions.\\n\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/Ord_Create_and_Update_GHPA.4dm has been modified to save a new GHPA as a first step, so it creates an ID, IDM and ComCode_Owner using the trigger.\\n\\n## Financial\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/FinT_CCY_UpdateRecord.4dm has been modified. A query line has been added:\\n```4D\\n$order2:=$order.query(\\"Ord_CropCode = :1 and Ord_Week = :2 and Ord_OrderType2 = :3 and Ord_Status # :4\\"; $CropCode_text; $YearPrev1+\\"@\\"; \\"Del@\\"; \\"Can@\\")\\n// highlight-next-line\\n$order2:=$order2.query(\\"Ord_Type_Start_Material # :1\\"; \\"Stage4\\")\\n```\\nThis new line (highlighted above) could easily be integrated into the query above it, saving a server call:\\n```4D\\n$order2:=$order.query(\\"Ord_CropCode = :1 and Ord_Week = :2 and Ord_OrderType2 = :3 and Ord_Status # :4 and Ord_Type_Start_Material # \'Stage4\'\\"; $CropCode_text; $YearPrev1+\\"@\\"; \\"Del@\\"; \\"Can@\\")\\n```\\n\\n## Order\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/Ord_ExportExcel_Flex.4dm now also exports the Company Name of Delivery2, instead of just the Comapny Code.\\n\\n## TCBP\\nSeveral methods have been added starting with `TCBP_`. It seems like some pre-work for drawing things on a canvas (canvas plugin from Rob). The idea is to create an overview of TC Planning Actions per week and per Batch as stated in [Issue #246](https://github.com/Iribov/Xiphium/issues/246).\\n\\n## Misc\\nMethod Project/Sources/Methods/PopupMenu_From_Collection.4dm has been adjusted to the new `#DECLARE` and `Var` syntax. The method now also ignores special characters for menu items, while still respecting the `-` special character as a line seprator.\\n\\n## Meme of the week\\n![](nothing_works.jpeg)\\n*Meme of the week is NOT a recurrent theme and is only instantiated whenever I feel like it.*"},{"id":"/2025/01/03/Xiphium-W01-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/03/Xiphium-W01-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2025-01-03-Xiphium-W01-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-03-Xiphium-W01-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2025-W01 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2025-01-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 3, 2025","tags":[],"readingTime":2.82,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W01 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W02 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/10/Xiphium-W02-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W52 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/28/Xiphium-W52-Update/Index"}},"content":"![](2025-happy-new-year-background-design-greeting-card-banner-poster-illustration-vector.jpg)\\n\\nHere is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n:::warning\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\n:::\\n\\n## Catalog changes\\nField \'Con_ID_Com\' is added to the [Contact] table.\\n\\n:::danger\\nSeveral tables have been renamed. This causes many changes in forms and methods, making it difficult/time consuming to decipher what has actually been changed, and what\'s just a consequence of the name change.\\n\\nFor this reason, only project method changes will be discussed this week.\\n:::\\n\\nTable [CropWeek] has been renamed to [CropC_Week]. \\n\\nTable [ComPCropY] has been renamed to [CropC_Year].\\n\\nField \'Doc_Rec_Link\' has been added to the [Document] table.\\n\\nTable [Items_Lines] has been renamed to [Table]. All fields have their prefix \'It_\' changed to \'Table_\'.\\n\\nAn automatic index is added for field [Mutations_Employee]MuEm_Date_Created.\\n:::tip\\nAutomatic indexes default to a B-Tree (except on boolean fields). A Cluster B-Tree index is beneficial for data that has repetition in it. The more repetition the data has, the more beneficial a cluster is. Because many [Mutations_Employee] records get created every day, many of them contain the same date, therefore making it more beneficial to Index as a cluster, compared to a regular B-Tree.\\n:::\\n\\n## Greenhouse_Field\\nMethod ***GF_ListboxHandler*** has been added. The method seems to be a preparation to provide functionality for Greenhouse-Field records displayed in a listbox. The method is not implemented anywhere yet.\\n\\n:::danger New year, new syntax!\\nMethod ***GF_ListboxHandler*** did not use the `#DECLARE` syntax for parameters, but used to old $1, $2 syntax.\\n\\n![](Im_Watching_You_Meme.jpg)\\n:::\\n\\n## Documents\\nMethod ***Doc_Updaterecord*** has been modified to update the amount of records linked to it. This number is saved into the new [Document]Doc_Rec_Link field.\\n\\n## Print Labels\\nA logical error has been fixed in several sticker printing methods.\\nThe previous code:\\n```4D\\n$data:=String_Substitute($data; \\"year\\"; String(Year of([TC_Reg_Emp]TC2E_Date)-2000; \\"00\\"))\\n```\\nTakes the year of the date and uses that year as part of a year-week format. This is not robust, the beginning of 2025 is a good example of that:\\n`30-12-2024 = 2025-W01`\\n\\nThis error is fixed by using the DateTime_GetYearWeekNr, which returns the correct year-week according to ISO 8601. Resulting in the following code:\\n```4D\\n\\t\\t$data:=String_Substitute($data; \\"year\\"; Substring(DateTime_GetYearWeekNr([TC_Reg_Emp:131]TC2E_Date); 3; 2))\\n```\\n\\n## Table\\nMethod ***Table_GetCustomTableName*** takes table pointer and returns the custom table name.  This method should/could be used in multiple places to set the user facing name of the table. For instance: every Output form has a Text field on the top left displaying the \'Custom Table Name\'. This is now done via hardcoded text, but should/could be replaced by this method so future name changes can be done once, and applied everywhere.\\n\\nMethod ***Table_GetPrimaryKey*** takes a table pointer and returns a pointer to the primary key field. This is now done by one big `Case Of` statement that needs to be filled manually whenever a table is added or a primary key is changed. ORDA can do this automatically using the following code:\\n```4D\\nds[tableName].getInfo().primaryKey\\n```\\n\\nThe entire method ***Table_GetPrimaryKey*** could be replaced with the following code:\\n```4D\\n// (PM) Table_GetPrimaryKey\\n// Returns the primary key fieldPointer for the given tablePointer\\n#DECLARE($tablePtr : Pointer)->$fieldPtr : Pointer\\nvar $tableName; $pKeyFieldName : Text\\nvar $fieldNr : Integer\\n\\n$tableName:=Table name($tablePtr)\\n$pKeyFieldName:=ds[$tableName].getInfo().primaryKey\\n$fieldNr:=ds[$tableName][$pKeyFieldName].fieldNumber\\n$fieldPtr:=Field(Table($tablePtr); $fieldNr)\\n```\\n*Do note that this method needs a valid table pointer, otherwise errors will be generated.*"},{"id":"/2024/12/28/Xiphium-W52-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/28/Xiphium-W52-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-12-28-Xiphium-W52-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-28-Xiphium-W52-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W52 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 28, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":2.635,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W52 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2025-W01 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2025/01/03/Xiphium-W01-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W51 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/19/Xiphium-W51-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\n\\n:::tip\\nEnjoy the holidays and a happy new year!\\n:::\\n\\n:::warning\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\n:::\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Project Mode\\nIn the next year we are planning to switch to 4D Project Mode. The switch to project mode will be a big one, mostly because we will change our workflow to local development with Git(Hub). Using the git client [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com) can help you learn Git faster and makes using it easier. Make sure to checkout their instruction videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyCj4RCToz5BEcpZgwLfAhzxVRlDY3z-O). Download the client (1 month free trial) and try it out yourself!\\n\\n![](Tower.png)\\n*more information on project mode and git will follow via email*\\n\\n### Highlight Buttons\\n(Almost) all higlight buttons have been replaced with either an invisible button or a 3D button. This is to facilitate the conversion to Project Mode, where Highlight buttons are no longer supported.\\n\\n## Analysis Order\\nForm [Analysis_Order]/AnO_Detail has a test with 2 new buttons. These 2 buttons have a dropdown menu to combine multiple buttons into 1. This is a test that will get feedback in the new year. This is an alternative way to the regular dropdown button to combine multiple buttons into 1 button. This cleans up the user interface a lot, and can still have help text if needed.\\n\\n![](Buttons.png)\\n\\nMethod ***AnPlate_ExportFCM_AnPla_Layout*** has been modified. A simple header text change was requested. The method has been updated with the new `#DECLARE` and `Var` syntax.\\n\\n## Greenhouse Field\\nA (regular) dropdown button is implemented to replace all the separate \'print label\' buttons. The previous \'print label\' dropdown menu is moved down to be deleted later (if no one misses this button). The individual \'print label\' buttons are still present for now, but will be moved down after the holidays as well.\\n\\n## ComProdWeek\\nMethod ***ComProdW_Sync_ExportXML*** now also includes Brasil (comcode: 006).\\n\\nMethod ***ComProdW_UpdateRecord_TCPA*** now has an exception case for Brasil. The worktype is not used as a filter for comcode 006.\\n\\n```4D\\nIf (Settings_GetDefaultCompany=\\"006\\")\\n\\t\\n\\t$TCPA:=ds.TC_Plan_Action.query(\\"TCPA_Week_Real = :1 and TCPA_ComCode_Prod = :2 and TCPA_Status # Delete@\\"\\\\\\n\\t\\t; $ComProdW->ComProdW_Week\\\\\\n\\t\\t; $ComProdW->ComProdW_ComCode)\\n\\t\\n\\t\\nElse \\n\\t$TCPA:=ds.TC_Plan_Action.query(\\"TCPA_Week_Real = :1 and TCPA_ComCode_Prod = :2 and TCPA_Work_Type = :3 and TCPA_Status # Delete@\\"\\\\\\n\\t\\t; $ComProdW->ComProdW_Week\\\\\\n\\t\\t; $ComProdW->ComProdW_ComCode\\\\\\n\\t\\t; $ComProdW->ComProdW_WorkType)\\nEnd if \\n```\\n\\n## Order\\nMethod ***Ord_UpdateRecord*** now has added calculations to calculate the number of stage 2, 3, and 4 plants (both prognose and regular amount) as well as a calculation for the week rooting. This is for the new type of Orders that go from Stage3 to Stage 5 in 1 go (instead of being split up to an order from Stage3 to Stage4 and a repotting Order).\\n\\n## Web stuff\\nMethod ***Web_TCStockCheckGetStock*** has been modified to include extra information on both the TC_Reg_Emp record, and mostly extra related TCPA information. This information can then be displayed in the app to give more context to the user when a jar is scanned.\\n\\n## Meme of the week\\n![](selfimprovement.jpeg)\\n*Meme of the week is NOT a recurrent theme and is only instantiated whenever I feel like it.*"},{"id":"/2024/12/19/Xiphium-W51-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/19/Xiphium-W51-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-12-19-Xiphium-W51-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-19-Xiphium-W51-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W51 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-12-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 19, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":3.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W51 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W52 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/28/Xiphium-W52-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W50 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/12/13/Xiphium-W50-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project Mode conversion\\r\\nHighlight buttons are not supported in project mode. They are automatically converted to invisible buttons. Some buttons gain the \'on mouse enter\' form event as a side effect.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Invoices\\r\\nA new tab called \'Documents\' is added to the access method ***Access_SetupCompanyMenu***. There are already 2 other with this name... \\r\\nA page 10 is added to the method ***Inv_SelectForDetail*** with what seems to be a document tab.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analysis Pathogen Cost Caclulation\\r\\nMethod ***An_Calc_Pathogen_Cost*** has been added. This method can calculate the expected cost of pathogen analysis done by the analytical lab based on several parameters. \\r\\n\\r\\n***Clo_Analysis_Cost_Calculation*** has been renamed to ***Cro_Analysis_Pathogen_Cost_Calc***. This method now takes a Crop entity to search for related Analysis_Groups and can calculate the analysis cost using the new ***An_Calc_Pathogen_Cost*** method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Note\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_GetNextDeliveryNoteNrPurcha*** has been modified. The SQL query has been altered so that comcode master is now ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiment\\r\\nMethod ***Exp_ExportToLocation*** has been added. This method uses the ***Exp_SyncExportExperiments*** to export experiments to another location of Xiphium.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***Exp_SyncExportDocuments***, ***Exp_SyncExportExpTreatments*** and ***Exp_SyncExportExperiments*** have been modified to facilitate the ability to manually synchronize experiments.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial Ledgers\\r\\nMethod ***FinLeM_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. The method now has an extra if statement that checks if \'type1\' contains a \'C\' before applyying the amount realized to the forecast:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nIf ([FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Status=\\"Prognosis\\")\\r\\n\\t[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_Open_SC:=[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_ForeCast2_SC-[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_Realized_SC\\r\\n// highlight-next-line\\r\\n\\tIf ([FinLed_Total]FinLeT_Type1#(\\"@\\"+\\"C\\"+\\"@\\"))\\r\\n\\t\\tIf ([FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_Realized_SC>[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_ForeCast2_SC)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_ForeCast2_SC:=[FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Amount_Realized_SC\\r\\n\\t\\tEnd if \\r\\n// highlight-next-line\\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse\\r\\n### GHPA\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Excel_Export*** has been modified. This square meters export method had some overlooked bugs that made it behave weirdly. The export works more stable now, but the results have not yet been verified.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***GHPA_Forwards_Calculation*** and ***GHPA_Forwards_Calc_Recursion*** have been modified. After some discussion, the way of doing the forwards calculation is revised. This is not yet implemented in the code.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** has bee extended with code fill the \'moving\' actions from the [GF_Locations_History] table. This code first looks for a matching week, if no actions are found, the search is widened by 1 week on each side (total of 3 weeks). Then the highest date is used as \'date realized\' and the \'plants planned\' become the \'plants realized\' (since the amount of plants moves is not kept in the [GF_Locations_History] or [Greenhouse_Field] tables).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_Create_and_Update_GHPA*** has been fixed of 2 issues. \\r\\n1. a single if statement prevented already created floating actions to behave as a floating action.\\r\\n2. The check whether changes made to a GHPA were actual changes in values was wrong. It always saved the GHPA (even if not needed!), thus wasting time. This check is now corrected.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_ArchiveBatch*** has been extended with the following code:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nIf (vOrd_DaysH1Set0#0)\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Cycle_H1_Manual:=0\\r\\n\\t$week2:=[Order]Ord_Week4\\r\\n\\t$date2:=DateTime_WeekNrToDate(Num:C11(Substring($week2; 6; 2)); Num:C11(Substring($week2; 1; 4)))\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Date_Planned:=$date2\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Date_Stage3:=[Order]Ord_Date_Planned+[Order]Ord_Cycle_H1_Manual\\r\\n\\t$date1:=[Order]Ord_Date_Stage3\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Week_Stage3:=DateTime_GetYearWeekNr($date1)\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Date_Modified3:=Current date\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_EmpName_Modified7:=Current user\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_UpdateRecord*** has been modified.

A classic query is replaced by an ORDA query.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analysis Cost\\r\\nMethod ***Clo_Analysis_Cost_Calculation*** has been added. This method accepts a clone entity, an optional amount of samples and an optional boolean to include the Order cost or not. After discussion with Analytical Lab we might want to split up the method into 2 core parts:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. A method that calculates the analysis cost based on amount of samples, amount of pathogens and the type of pathogens.\\r\\n2. A method that accepts a Crop, PlantCode and/or Clone and searches for a relate Analysis Group. This method can use method 1 to calculate cost.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Planning\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Delete_Actions*** has been adjusted to only remove deleted actions from the listbox and listbox selection of the selection is defined (gave errors in other places).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Excel_Export*** has been adjusted to correctly export square meter information of actions that started before the selected year, but are still in the greenhouse in the selected year (only if the GHPA record of this previous year is in the current selection!).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** has been updated. The method now gets information from Greenhouse-Field related to repotting.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Math\\r\\nMethods ***Math_Ceil*** and ***Math_Floor*** have been added. The methods seem to do functionally the same as the ***RoundUp*** and ***RoundDown*** methods. After quick testing, the \'Round\' method are usually slightly faster, but they are both so fast it doesn\'t have significant impact on run time. These new methods should be removed and references should be replaced with the ***RoundUp*** and ***RoundDown*** methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThe **#DECLARE** and **Var** syntax was not used for these new methods. This makes me very upset :\'(\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nIf your\'re rounding up -12.4 what should you get? the definition of Math Ceiling (as well as the method) says it should -12.

The method now takes the \'Plants Present\' from Greenhouse Field as the amount of plants to calculate with when the previous action is done, and the current action is not done yet. This is necessary due to losses and deliveries that are not planned.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Flexlist_Export*** has been added. It\'s a first version of a flexlist export, more options will come in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_Create_and_Update_GHPA*** has been modified to keep the correct order of GHPAs.  In 2024-W43, a query was added to exclude floating actions from an entity selection used as an \'anchor\' (floating actions can never be an anchor). Problem is, queries don\'t respect ordered entitySelections, so the selection became unordered and causing problematic side-effects in chaining GHPAs after each other \\r\\n(they all linked to the first GHPA).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Forwards_Calculation*** is updated with the new **#DECLARE** and **Var** syntax.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** has been refactored for simplifying the logic and better readability.\\r\\n\\r\\n### GHPA Overview\\r\\nWhen batch modifying the Greenhouse Protocol Code of Orders, there is now a list picker in place.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen removing the manual protocol code, the GHPAs will now be updated using the Automatic Protocol. Other fields of the Order listbox have been set to non-enterable.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Ledgers\\r\\nLedgerGroupMonth has a new tab added to its access called \\"FinLGM IF Ledger In Group MC\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLeM_UpdateRecord*** has modified. The method now fills the date fields again (date begin and date end) from the month field. This was removed in 20224-W20, and caused issues with the Ledger Dashboard. (**C_** variable declarations have been replaced by the new **Var** syntax)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Month\\r\\nMethod ***PlantM_UpdateRecord*** now fills the IDM of the record.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Lab\\r\\nButton DiT_Button_Import3 in AnO_Detail has been modified. The import button is used 1-3x a year for Bejo, and was not updated with the new rules ([Analysis_Sample] ALWAYS needs to be connected to an [Analysis_SubOrder]). The method is now updated with this rule, as well as the new **#DECLARE** and **Var** syntax.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Utility Methods\\r\\nMethods ***RoundDown*** and ***RoundUp*** have been modified with the new **#Declare** and **Var** syntax, making the methods even shorter and easier to read.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***Web_LocSettingsController*** has been modified. The Case of statement has no need for an $id anymore, and the \'Locations Get\' and \'Locations Post\' options have been added.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***Web_LocSettingsGetLocation*** and ***Web_LocSettingsGetLocations*** now include the UserID in the reply.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_LocSettingsSaveLocations*** has been added.

Maybe it\'s easier to store the ID of the used protComp, but for now it\'s both fine. This method is implemented in the ***GHPA_Update_Prot*** method, which contained this code before the abstraction.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_DuplicateData*** has been modified to be better readable (implement `#DECLARE` and remove unnecessary local variables).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** has been modified to get the date for the \'FP\' (Flower Photo) action of TTT Orders from the Greenhouse-Field field \'Week Ready\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GHPA*** has been modified to get the day and night temperatures as seperate fields (instead of 1 text field).

Dates have been moved from the en of 2024 to the middle of 2025.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Access\\r\\nseveral access methods have been added:\\r\\n1. ***AccFunc_GroupCount***\\r\\n2. ***AccFunc_UserCount***\\r\\n3. ***AccGr_OverviewStats***\\r\\n4. ***AccTab_GroupCount***\\r\\n5. ***AccTab_UserCount***\\r\\n\\r\\n***AccGr_OverviewStats*** seems to be a method that gets (user) access information to show to the user. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_UpdateRecord_GF*** has been added to update information in the GH_Plan_Actions from Greenhouse_Field (not all actions re/can be included in this).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Breeding\\r\\nMethod ***BreGeno_PrintBatchLabelBreeding*** has been extended to include the \'BreedName\' in the label.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_UpdateRecord*** has been modified.

Analysis_Lysis\\r\\n2. Analysis_Lysis_Plate\\r\\n\\r\\nAnalysis_Lysis has been inserted between Analysis_Sample and Analysis_Isolation to facilitate the user to create seperate Lysis and Isolation plates (before, these were considered \'the same\' plate).\\r\\nThis change was necessary since from the first design of the Analytical Lab automation, a \'lysis plate\' and \'elution plate\' were always identical, hence the previous \'isolation plate\' was enough to cover them both. Since then, new techniques have been adopted making this assumption untrue, and a necessity for the extra \'lysis\' tables was born. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis change was first developed seperately in project mode, so the changes could be tracked. The tracked changes came to 360 files changed, of which 60 are project methods (in project mode, every object method is also a file. So deleting/adding objects with a method can result in many file changes).\\r\\nImplementing these changes was done manually, copy and pasted file by file. UI changed had to be done manually, object by object.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter implementation, some bugs were reported. This was mostly due to copy/paste mistakes, and partially due to project mode differences and incomplete testing beforehand.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nIt is not recommended to do big changes like this without using project mode in production. All the manual copy+pasting took many hours, and can be replaced by a single \'merge\', resulting in many more hours available for testing.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nAll file changes regarding this major update will be ignored for the rest of this blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Dashboard\\r\\nNew Dashboard page has been added showing several TPPs:\\r\\n- TPP Rooting\\r\\n- TPP Delivered\\r\\n- TPP Planted\\r\\n- TPP Accepted/Invoiced\\r\\n### Plant Company Year\\r\\nMethod ***PlaCY_UpdateRecord*** has been updated to calculate more kinds of Transfer per Plant (TPP) to facilitate the dashboard.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dashboard can show either a bar chart for the selected years, or a bubble chart showing the TPP of the last selected year but the total amount of plants of the selected years.\\r\\n\\r\\n## DeliveryNote\\r\\nFilter is made to filter records where Pending 1 or Pending 2 is not 0.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nGo to option added to \'Go to Prices\' using method ***Ord_Goto_Prices***\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project2_Year\\r\\nSome fields have been renamed:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Old fieldname | New fieldname |\\r\\n| -- | -- |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_Saldo_Budget_Cost |  Pro2Y_Am_A_Saldo |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Invoiced_TC | Pro2Y_Am_B_TC_Saldo |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Invoiced_Ana | Pro2Y_Am_B_Ana_Saldo |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Invoiced_GF | Pro2Y_Am_B_GF_Invoiced |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Invoiced_Other | Pro2Y_Am_B_Other_Saldo |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Invoiced_Total | Pro2Y_Am_B_Total_Invoiced \\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_Saldo_Budget_Cost_MP | Pro2Y_Am_A_Saldo_MP |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_B_Tot_Budget_Saldo | Pro2Y_Am_B_Tot_Saldo |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Budget_Real | Pro2Y_Am_C_Real |\\r\\n| Pro2Y_Am_C_Budget_Saldo | Pro2Y_Am_C_Saldo |\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd three new fields have been added:\\r\\n- Pro2Y_Rec_Pro2W\\r\\n- Pro2Y_Am_D_Invoiced\\r\\n- Pro2Y_Hour_Saldo\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Documents\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_CopyDocument*** has been adjusted to be able to suppress the alert when a document is not found.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Exp_SyncExportDocuments*** has been adjusted to only try to export a document if it exists on the server.

Probably in preparation of combining/Importing articles from other locations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Field\\r\\nMethod ***GF_PrintBatchLabelMultiple*** has been added. The method name indicates that it facilitates the printing of many labels at once related to greenhouse-field.\\r\\n\\r\\nButton \\"TC2E_Button_PrintLabels8\\" in form \\"GF_List\\" has been added. The button contains code that seems to the new ***GF_PrintBatchLabelMultiple*** method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiment\\r\\nThe [Experiment];\\"Exp_CreateRecord_Dialog\\" has been updated to conform to the current Experiment code standard. This was particularly difficult given the given standard standard has not been followed well. \\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Details</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe standard for an experiment code is `[Year]-[2 letter code of country]-[CropCode]-[Sequence Number]` Example: `2024-NL-063-001`. The inconsistency (apart from experiments that didn\'t use this standard at all) was in the [CropCode] and [Sequence Number]. Both of these sometimes contained leading zero(s), and sometimes not. This made it difficult to calculate the next sequence number.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution was to use regex to match the experiment code to this \'loose\' standard (with or without leading zeros). The regex was easily created using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com): `^\\\\\\\\d{4}-[A-Z]{2}-\\\\\\\\d{1,4}-\\\\\\\\d{1,4}$`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$maxSequenceNumber:=0\\r\\nFor each ($experiment; $experiments)\\r\\n\\tIf (Match regex(\\"^\\\\\\\\d{4}-[A-Z]{2}-\\\\\\\\d{1,4}-\\\\\\\\d{1,4}$\\"; $experiment.Exp_ExperimentCode))  //only count if experiment contains experimet code with format: [Year]-[country 2 character alpha code]-[CropCode]-[sequenceNumber]\\r\\n\\t\\t$splitString:=Split string($experiment.Exp_ExperimentCode; \\"-\\"; sk ignore empty strings+sk trim spaces)\\r\\n\\t\\tIf ($splitString.length>0)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t$sequenceNumber:=Num($splitString[$splitString.length-1])  //assume the last part of experiment code is the sequence number\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t$maxSequenceNumber:=New collection($maxSequenceNumber; $sequenceNumber).max()\\r\\n\\t\\tEnd if \\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\nEnd for each \\r\\n$sequenceNumber:=$maxSequenceNumber+1\\r\\n$experimentCode.push(Choose($sequenceNumber<1000; String($sequenceNumber; \\"000\\"); String($sequenceNumber)))\\r\\n\\r\\n//join for experiment code (should be unique)\\r\\nForm.ExperimentCode:=$experimentCode.join(\\"-\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nthe \'if\' statement after the `Match Regex` function is not necessary since all experiment codes that hit this code, are conform with the standard and thus will always be split into a collection of 4 elements.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Services\\r\\n2 label printing buttons have been deleted after their functionality have been moved to a dropdown button 6 months ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Analysis Isolation Plate Status+Scanning\\r\\nProject form \\"AnIsoPlate_RepurposeForResearch\\" has been added. This popup screen asks the user what project2 they want to connect the isolation plate to and re-purposes the isolation plate form production to research, giving it the status \'Research\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis was a request from the analytical lab to not accidentally throw away plates that are used for research after the production process. The only confusing part is that combined plates (plates used for both research and production) and plates used for research only don\'t have this \'Research\' status.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have also introduced the status \'discarded\' after the (elution) plates have been thrown away, instead of leaving them on \'reported\' like we used to.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral forms and methods have been modified to account for this new status.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Stuff\\r\\nOn request, some web methods have been modernized to using the #DECLARE function instead of the classic $0, $1 etc. for variable declaration.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following methods have been added for the locations app:\\r\\n- Web_LocSettingsGetLocation\\r\\n- Web_LocSettingsGetUser\\r\\n- Web_LocSettingsSaveLocation\\r\\n\\r\\n## Misc\\r\\nA few v20 project mode compiler errors have been resolved by removing some \':\' from the end of local variables."},{"id":"/2024/08/22/Xiphium-W34-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/22/Xiphium-W34-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-08-22-Xiphium-W34-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-22-Xiphium-W34-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W34 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-08-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 22, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":3.135,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W34 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W35 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/30/Xiphium-W35-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W33 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/16/Xiphium-W33-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nMany changes were made this week.

These errors are mostly `:` instead of `;` (for separating variables in the declaration) or a useless `;` at the end of a line, for example:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nC_LONGINT(vInteger1:vInteger2)\\r\\n```\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nC_BOOLEAN($bool);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis has been going on for a while, but from this week on I will correct these syntax errors.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial\\r\\nDetail tab added to Ledger Group called \'Ledger Month\' in access method ***Access_SetupLedgerMenu***\\r\\nDetail tab added to Ledger Year called \'Month MC\' in access method ***Access_SetupLedgerMenu***\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral \'Clear\' methods related to financial tables have been modified (methods used to clear variables used for querying).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLGT_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. The queries for calculating totals from [FinLeG_Total] have been optimized. The results should be the same, but the code is now better readable and possibly even faster in execution time.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLeM_UpdateRecord*** has been modified to to store the intercompany boolean from its related [Ledger_total]. \\r\\n:::note\\r\\nWhy does the [Ledger_Month] need to copy a boolean from a record it is already related to?!\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nWhen a new parameter is used for a query, instead of querying the entitySelection, add the new parameter to the existing query. This will reduce execution time because there will be less server/client communication necessary. Also, hardcoded values could/should be inside the query string for extra clarity (except for dates!).\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead of:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$FinLeM:=ds.FinLed_Month.query(\\"FinLeM_LedgerCode = :1 and FinLeM_Month = :2 and FinLeM_ComCode_MC = :3\\"; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_LedgerCode; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Month; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_ComCode)\\r\\n$FinLeM:=$FinLeM.query(\\"FinLeM_InterCompany = :1\\"; False)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nDo:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$FinLeM:=ds.FinLed_Month.query(\\"FinLeM_LedgerCode = :1 and FinLeM_Month = :2 and FinLeM_ComCode_MC = :3 and FinLeM_InterCompany = False\\"; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_LedgerCode; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_Month; [FinLed_Month]FinLeM_ComCode)\\r\\n```\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLeT_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. It seems like a minor optimization in execution speed by commenting out duplicate operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLeY_UpdateRecord*** now copies the intercompany boolean from its related ledger total.\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nWhy does the [Ledger_Year] need to copy a boolean from a record it is already related to?!\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_CreateRecord_ComCrop*** has been renamed to Ord_Create_ComCrop and the code is also copied to Ord_Create_ComCrop_x.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_CreateRecord_Prices*** has been renamed to ***Ord_Create_Prices***\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Total\\r\\n***Clear_PlantT*** has been extended with 20 more variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***PlantT_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. The method now calculates \'Plants Present\' and \'Order\' amounts for location 1 through 6 (all in seperate fields). There is now also the \'multiloc\' field that shows in how many locations there are plants ordered (with a threshold of 1.000 plants minimum).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project2_Year\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. The \'Budget Order\' is now correctly calculated, dividing delivery orders and non delivery orders properly (before, the division was between delivery orders and all orders).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiments\\r\\nMethod ***Scanning_ClosePrinting*** has 1 new line added:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nREDUCE SELECTION([Exp_Treatment]; 0)\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis code snippet is inside a for loop, and is trying to fix a bug where only 1 out of n treatments is made in the classic Experiment scan menu.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Access\\r\\nMethods ***Tab_GetFirstAccessibleTab*** and ***Tab_GotoPage*** have been added.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***Compiler_WebApp*** has been removed, and the code has been implemented in ***Compiler_Methods*** and ***Compiler_Variables***.\\r\\n\\r\\nConstant \'Xiphium Location Settings App ID\' has been added.\\r\\n\\r\\nSeveral optimizations and changes done to several methods (too much to summarize here).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_LocSettingsController*** has been added.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Meme of the week\\r\\n![](Problem_Solution.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n*Meme of the week is NOT a recurrent theme and is only instantiated whenever I feel like it.*"},{"id":"/2024/08/16/Xiphium-W33-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/16/Xiphium-W33-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-08-16-Xiphium-W33-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-16-Xiphium-W33-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W33 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-08-16T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 16, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.9,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W33 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W34 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/22/Xiphium-W34-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W32 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/09/Xiphium-W32-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n## Company\\r\\nMethod ***Com_UpdateRecord_Val*** now does a query to [Com_History] to check if there is only 1 [Com_History] history record with status \'current\' and identical \'ComCode_Prod\'\\r\\n\\r\\n<details> \\r\\n\\r\\n<summary>Com_UpdateRecord_Val Code addition</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nC_OBJECT($comHist)\\r\\n$comHist:=ds.Com_History.query(\\"ComH_ComCode = :1 and ComH_Status = :2\\"; [Company]Com_ComCode_Num; \\"Curr@\\")\\r\\nIf ($comHist.length=1)\\r\\n\\t$comHist:=$comHist.first()\\r\\n\\t[Company]Com_ComCode_Prod:=$comHist.ComH_ComCode_Prod\\r\\nElse \\r\\n\\t[Company]Com_ComCode_Prod:=0\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Employee Job\\r\\nMethod ***EmJo_Excel_Export*** has a new colums called \\"MF\\", which exports the multiplication factor, calculated as \'totalTransfers\'/totalScanned\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_ExportExcel_Flex*** Now has an extra (optional) column: \'Clones in T4 TCPA\'.

In 4D 20R4 the #DECLARE replaces the need for the ***Compiler_*** methods. It is recommended to use the #DECLARE syntax for this reason but also, the declaration of the function is displayed in the status bar exactly as it is for 4D commands.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor this reason I propose that when making adjustments to a method, to also replace the classic parameter declarations with the #DECLARE syntax.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nKeep in mind that the parameters declared with the #DECLARE are always initialized to their default data type (integer defaults to 0, Text defaults to \\"\\", etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nChecking if a parameter is passed to the method should be done using the **Count parameters** function and not the **Undefined()** function.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nCheck out the documentation and blog posts about #DECLARE:\\r\\n\\r\\n[Parameters | 4D Docs](https://developer.4d.com/docs/Concepts/parameters/#declaring-parameters)\\r\\n\\r\\n[Streamlined Method Parameter Declarations \u2013 4D Blog](https://blog.4d.com/streamlined-method-parameter-declarations/)\\r\\n\\r\\n[Coder-friendly syntax for class functions and methods \u2013 4D Blog](https://blog.4d.com/coder-friendly-syntax-for-class-functions-and-methods/)\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n## Experiment\\r\\nMethod ***Exp_UpdateRecord*** has been modified to look for related documents using ORDA instead of classic queries.\\r\\n\\r\\nButton Dit_Btn_CreateEmail7 has been added to form [Experiments]:\\"Exp_Detail\\". The button seems to export documents to a folder. It seems this is a test to export all treatment pictures at once (which has been a request form researchers).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Experiment Scan Menu\\r\\nCreating Experiments and treatment via the scan menu did not result in fully \'filled\' records. \\r\\nThe TCPG_ID and Activity Code are now added when creating a treatment.

This method asks for 2 years and compares every ProjectGroup_Year - Project2_Year connection of these 2 years. This can be useful to see what has changed between 2 years.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\n\\r\\nButtons vScan_Btn_Close8 and vScan_Btn_Close9 have been added to form [Order]:\\"Ord_List\\". Both buttons seem to import Order records from the clipboard. There are some changes between the 2 buttons. It has probably been a test.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Maintenance app\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_MaintenanceController*** has a new action called \\"maintenance\\" with method \\"GET\\". This option calls the method ***Web_MaintenanceGetEquipment***, which returns details of the given equipment ID. Part of ***Web_MaintenanceGetEquipment*** has been abstracted to new method ***Web_MaintenanceGetMaintenance***. This method converts the equipment maintenance record to an object.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_MaintenanceSaveMaintenance*** has been modified to fix bugs and improve functionality.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Misc\\r\\n- Method ***DateTime_ConvertfromISODate*** has been modified.

The method now extract the amount of [PlantTotal] and [Cultivars] records related to it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe [Tax_Spec] forms have also received some updates, as can be seen by the modifications of methods ***TaxSpec_SelectForDetail*** and ***TaxSpec_Sum***\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial Turnover\\r\\nMethod ***FinTuY_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted to so that when 0 related orders are found, a 0 is entered in the accompanied fields\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nThere is a way to do the same thing, but with less lines of code, improving the readability.\\r\\n\\r\\nRight now, the code is as follows:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$order:=ds.Order.query(\\"Ord_ComCode_Sup = :1 and Ord_ComCode_Customer = :2 and Ord_Year = :3 and Ord_Status # :4 and Ord_Status # :5\\"; vComCode_Cred_Text; vComCode_Deb_Text; $year_text; \\"can@\\"; \\"fin@\\")\\r\\n$count:=$order.count(\\"Ord_ID_Ordernumber\\")\\r\\nIf ($count#0)\\r\\n\\t[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Order_Total:=$order.sum(\\"Ord_Cost_Total\\")\\r\\n\\t[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Prog_Total:=$order.sum(\\"Ord_Cost_Total_Prog\\")\\r\\nElse \\r\\n\\t[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Order_Total:=0\\r\\n\\t[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Prog_Total:=0\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\nAfter the query, a check is done if there are any orders found (using the .count() function). If there are orders found, sum up the required numbers, else, put a 0.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don\'t have to do an if else statement to guard for the possibility of not finding any orders. Using the ***Num()*** function, we can achieve the same thing but with less lines of code:\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$order:=ds.Order.query(\\"Ord_ComCode_Sup = :1 and Ord_ComCode_Customer = :2 and Ord_Year = :3 and Ord_Status # :4 and Ord_Status # :5\\"; vComCode_Cred_Text; vComCode_Deb_Text; $year_text; \\"can@\\"; \\"fin@\\")\\r\\n[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Order_Total:=Num($order.sum(\\"Ord_Cost_Total\\"))\\r\\n[FinTurCom_Year]FinTuY_TO_Prog_Total:=Num($order.sum(\\"Ord_Cost_Total_Prog\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, when there are no Orders found, the $order.sum() will return Null or Undefined, using the ***Num()*** function, this will get transformed into a 0, eliminating the need for a check and If/Else statement.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. There are 2 Else statements added that when a \'Week\' field is empty, the corresponding \'Year\' field will be 0. But when the \'Week\' is empty, why not let the standard functions do their job and fill in empty values in month and year?\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nThere is a way to do the same thing, but with less lines of code, improving the readability.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following code tries to convert a year-week to a year-month and year:\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nIf ([Order:]Ord_Week#\\"\\")\\r\\n\\t$week:=[Order]Ord_Week\\r\\n\\t$date:=DateTime_WeekNrToDate(Num(Substring($week; 6; 2)); Num(Substring($week; 1; 4)))\\r\\n\\t$month:=DateTime_GetYearMonthNr($date)\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Date_Planned:=$date\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Month:=$month\\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Year:=Year of($date)\\r\\nElse \\r\\n\\t[Order]Ord_Year:=0\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it is desirable to have the year and month be 0 (and \\"\\") when the week is empty, it\'s better to remove the If/Else statement and let the functions do their job. We can also remove the local variables as they make the code unnecessarily longer (and use the better suited ***DateTime_YearWeekNrToDate*** method instead of the ***DateTime_WeekNrToDate*** to convert a year-week to a date). All of these tricks combined results in the following code:\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n[Order]Ord_Date_Planned:=DateTime_YearWeekNrToDate([Order]Ord_Week)\\r\\n[Order]Ord_Month:=DateTime_GetYearMonthNr([Order]Ord_Date_Planned)\\r\\n[Order]Ord_Year:=Year of([Order]Ord_Date_Planned)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nKeep in mind that this code will change the [Order]Ord_Date_Planned to !00-00-00! and the [Order]Ord_Month to \\"\\", which is different behavior than the original code.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Plan Action\\r\\nMethods ***TCPA_SyncExportTCPlanActions*** and ***TCPA_SyncExportTCPlanActionsN_1*** have been adjusted. The methods now have an additional field to synchronize. This is the [TC_Plan_Action]TCPA_Locations field.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Plan Cycle\\r\\nButton vScan_Btn_Close5 in form [TC_Plan_Cycle];\\"TCPC_List\\" has been added. This button seems to import Load planning cycles based on the pasteboard content.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Year\\r\\nMethod ***PlantY_UpdateRecord*** has been modified to extract extra information from delivery items. The amount Stage 3 plants poduced by company codes 1 through 6 are now calculated in their respective (newly created) fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***PlantY_UpdateRecord_Val*** has been modified to record the last time the record was updated. It also searches for records identical to itself.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nIf you quickly want to find duplicate records, the method ***duplicates*** is highly optimized to do so. Unfortunately it is only compatible with a single alpha/text field (for now)\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nButton PlantY_Btn_DistributePlantPrev in form [PlantYear];\\"PlantY_Detail\\" has been modified. The button now calculates the forecast in a different way.\\r\\n\\r\\n## DeliveryNote\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_CreateDeliveryNote*** and button Ord_Dialog_InD_Btn_OK of form [Order];\\"Ord_Dialog_DiT\\" have been modified. Where there used to be 3 ***DB_UnlockRecord***, are now 3 UNLOAD RECORD function calls. Probably because method ***DB_UnlockRecord*** puts the given table to READ ONLY mode, while UNLOAD RECORD doesn\'t change the Read/Write mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Lab\\r\\nAnO Detail now sorts samples by SampleCode instead of ID.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***AnPlate_ExportFCM_AnPla_Layout*** has been adjusted to better display the exported information.\\r\\n\\r\\nIsolation plate has a new option for blocked wells called \'PCR temporary\' that block wells B01, B02, D01, and G10. This is now also the default option when creating an isolation plate.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***Web_MaintenanceController*** has been modified. It seems that method ***Web_DocumentsSendFile*** has been split into two methods: \\r\\n1. ***Web_MaintenanceGetDocument*** \\r\\n2. ***WebApp_SetJSONResponse***\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is probably done for better maintainability and/or reusability.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_MaintenanceGetDocument*** has been simplified by removing the $reply.mimeType property, and removing the first parameter called $action (leaving only the parameter called $id).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_MaintenanceGetEquipment*** has been modified. The $document.url property is removed. Also, a commented out QUERY BY FORMULA has had its last comparison removed."},{"id":"/2024/07/28/Xiphium-W30-Update/Index","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/07/28/Xiphium-W30-Update/Index","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-07-28-Xiphium-W30-Update/Index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-28-Xiphium-W30-Update/Index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W30 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-07-28T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 28, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.885,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W30 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W31 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/08/02/Xiphium-W31-Update/Index"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W29 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/07/22/Xiphium-W29-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crop Week\\r\\nMethod ***CroWe_UpdateRecord_TCPA*** has removed the \'WorkType = 11\' of the TCPA query, reverting the change done to it in week 2024-W28.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliveries\\r\\nMethods ***DeN_ImportItems***, ***Ord_CreateDeliveryNote*** and ***Puit_CreateDeliveryNote*** and buttons \'Ord_Dialog_DiT/Ord_Dialog_InD_Btn_OK\', \'Ord_Dialog_DiT_No_DeN/Ord_Dialog_InD_Btn_OK\', \'BreCros_Dialog_DiT/Ord_Dialog_InD_Btn_OK\' and \'BreGeno_Dialog_DiT/Ord_Dialog_InD_Btn_OK\'  have been modified to create an IDMT for newly created [Delivery_Items].\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** has been modified.

This makes handling the logic of each screen more digestible and readable.

The exact changes are hard to read from the code diff.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***TCPG_UpdateRecord*** line 139 has been adjusted. The search for delivery items now excludes delivery items that are being delivered to comcode 001. This is done so that the field [TC_Plan_Group]TCPG_N_StartPlants_Delivered does not include plants sent to Iribov NL.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThe adjusted query in question is the following:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$productionLoc:=[TC_Plan_Group]TCPG_ComCode_ProductionLoc\\r\\n\\r\\n$dit:=ds.Delivery_Items.query(\\"Dit_Pla_PlantCode = :1 and DiT_ComCode_Delivery_To # :2 and DiT_ComCode_Delivery_To # :3\\"; vplantcode; $productionLoc; \\"001\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new addition of the third parameter is intended to exclude internal deliveries to be counted as \'delivered plants\'.

It seems like the method got some extra error handling needed for practical use.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Documents\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_ConvertDocument*** has been added to convert .HEIC files to .JPG.

This optimizes performance since now, the query call returns the entitySelection already ordered, instead of needing to do an additional server request with the .orderBy function.\\r\\n\\r\\nReducing the network calls from 2 to 1 makes this query about 2x as fast. Queries and data communications between server and client are often the slowest parts of our code. Optizing these parts will make the methods run faster. This is even more true when connecting to Xiphium via VPN!\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Code change</summary>\\r\\nold code (2 server requests):\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$selection:=ds:C1482.Analysis_Isolation_Plate.query(\\"AnIsoPlate_PlateName = :1\\"; $year+\\"-@\\")\\r\\n$selection:=$selection.orderBy(\\"AnIsoPlate_PlateName\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nnew code (1 server request):\\r\\n\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$selection:=ds:C1482.Analysis_Isolation_Plate.query(\\"AnIsoPlate_PlateName = :1 order by AnIsoPlate_PlateName asc\\"; $year+\\"-@\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nCombining the \'query\' and \'Order By\' into a single network request is NOT possible using classic 4D code.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***AnIso_SelectForDetail*** has been optimized to directly query using ORDA, instead of doing a classic Query and converting it to ORDA using \'Create Entity Selection\' (however, the \'Create Entity Selection\' line still needs to be removed).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Note\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***DeN_Create_PDF_AN_GF*** and ***DeN_Create_PDF_DN_GF*** have been added. The methods create some kind of report of the Delivery Note\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_Detail_ListboxHandler*** is added. The method handles the custom events \\"On Filter\\" and \\"On Tools Button\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_ExportExcel_Pending*** has been added. This method exports DeliveryNote fields of the current selection.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_Print_Address_Label*** has been added. This method print the Address Label using the \\"DeN_Print_AddressLabel12\\" tableform and functions \'FORM SET OUTPUT\' and \'PRINT RECORD\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Documents\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_ShowDetailFormPreview*** has been added. This method can show a preview of documents in a seperate window. \\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***File_CanPreviewInWebArea*** and ***File_GetMimeType*** have been extended with the \\"heic\\" extension. This means that files with this extension can now be previewed using method ***Doc_ShowDetailFormPreview***.\\r\\n\\r\\nForm \\"Doc_ListFormPreview2\\" has new buttons \'DocumentIcon\' and \'DownloadButton\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiment\\r\\nMethod ***Exp_UpdateRecord*** now searches for documents related to its treatments and saves the amount found in field \'Exp_Rec_Doc_ExT\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Treatment\\r\\nMethod ***ExT_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted so that Obervation Percentage fields are now calculated using the \'ExT_N1_Explants\' field instead of the \'ExT_N2_Plant_Analysed\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fincancial\\r\\nSome work has been done on the financial tables. It\'s too much effort to write down all the changes, but changes have been made to methods:\\r\\n1. FinCM_Sum\\r\\n2. FinCM_UpdateRecord\\r\\n3. FinT_CCM_UpdateRecord\\r\\n4. FinT_CCT_UpdateRecord\\r\\n\\r\\n## TCPA\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_SyncExportDelitemsResults*** has field \'DiT_N_17_Del_NoInfo\' added to its massive oneline QUERY BY FORMULA. This line finds all records with any amount of plants in any of the given fields, and/or if it has any text in field \'DiT_Q_Remarks\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_SyncExportTCPlanGroups*** has been changed to export the last 2 weeks instead of the last 5 days.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***WebApp_Startup*** has 2 \'locations\' API endpoints modified to use method ***Web_LocationsController*** instead of ***Web_TCLocationsController***.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_LocationsController*** has been added. This method is used in API in both the \'tc-locations\' and the newer \'locations\' endpoints.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***Web_LocationsControllerNew***, ***Web_LocationsGetAllLocations***, ***Web_LocationsGetJar***, ***Web_LocationsSaveJar***, ***Web_LocationsGetLocation***, ***Web_LocationsRefreshScanData***, ***Web_LocationsSaveScanData***, ***Web_LocationsUploadScanData*** have been added. These methods probably add a lot of functionality to the locations app.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Clone\\r\\nThe \'Create Record\' buttons that call the \\"Clo_Create_Record_Screen\\" Form now also auto fill the plantcode when no Clone is selected, but a Plant_Code record is in the current selection. This should make it easier to create new clones without typos in the Plant Code. Not all subforms have a \'create record\' button, but they all do have an \'add record\' button.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Catalog changes\\r\\nCatalog changes indicate changes in the database structure. These could be:\\r\\n- Field changes (additions, renaming, removal)\\r\\n- Index changes\\r\\n- Table changes\\r\\n\\r\\nTable [Fin_Com_Month] has a lot of changes in its fields.

These options are also added the the \'Edit\' menu. We probably need to add some protection to these options if we don\'t want everyone to be able to use them.\\r\\n![](menu.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n## DeliveryNote\\r\\nThe trigger in delivery not has been adjusted. When a deliveryNote is adjusted from any status to status \'shipped\', an email is sent.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Clone\\r\\nA new button is added that searches for the origin clones of a Clone selection.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***Web_DeliveriesRefresh*** has a new line: `$item.barcode:=[TC_Reg_Emp]TC2E_Barcode` to return the barcode form the found record.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Unload Record\\r\\nSeveral methods have a \'unload record\' added:\\r\\n- ***DiT_Goto_DeN***\\r\\n- ***Settings_GetDefaultCompany***\\r\\n- ***Settings_GetDefaultCompany_Num***\\r\\nThis is probably added to prevent issues with blocking records or something."},{"id":"/2024/05/24/Xiphium-W21-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/05/24/Xiphium-W21-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-05-24-Xiphium-W21-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-24-Xiphium-W21-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W21 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-05-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 24, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":3.595,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W21 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W22 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/05/31/Xiphium-W22-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W20 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/05/21/Xiphium-W20-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n## Delivery Items Dashboard\\r\\nThe delivery items dashboard has received some bugfixes and improvements:\\r\\n- Date matrix now works as intended\\r\\n- Cultivar graphs use the same logic as the Crop graphs, just a different selection (better maintainability)\\r\\n- PlantCode and Cultivar Origin were used in an unclear mix. This is now all set to Cultivar Origin.\\r\\n- Other small optimizations and improvements\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Com Prod Year\\r\\nMethod ***Access_SetupPlantsMenu*** has been adjusted. All output and input forms of \'Plant Com Prod Year\' (or \'PlaCY\') have been renamed in this method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Company History (ComH)\\r\\nMethod ***ComH_UpdateRecord*** now adds the current date and current user to its \'Date_Created\', \'Date Modified\' and \'EmpName Created\', \'EmpName Modifed\' fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crop\\r\\n\\r\\n### Crop Synchronisation\\r\\nMethod ***Cro_SyncExportCrops*** now also includes fields [Crop]Cro_Transport_Temp_Stage2 and [Crop]Cro_Transport_Temp_Stage3. The variable $lastweek has also been changed from `Current date-7` to `Current date-150` meaning that changes from 150 days ago are now exported for synchronization. This is probably done temporarily to properly synchronize the newly added fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Crop \'Import transport temp\' button\\r\\nButton \'vScan_Btn_Close5\' was added to the Crop List tab 5 (certification). This button gets text from the pasteboard consisting of the following data:\\r\\n- Crop Code Number\\r\\n- Temperature Stage 2\\r\\n- Temperature Stage 3\\r\\nThe button then finds the crop record matching the Crop Code and puts the temperature in their respected fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial\\r\\nSeveral field name changes in [Fin_Com_Month]:\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Field name changes</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\n| Old Name | New Name |\\r\\n| - | - |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Loans_In | FinCM_L_Loan_In_Real |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Loans_Out | FinCM_L_Loan_Out_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Mut_Cred | FinCM_L_Mut_Cred_Real |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Mut_Deb | FinCM_L_Mut_Deb_Real |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Investment | FinCM_L_Invest_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Liq_In_Sum | FinCM_L_Liq_In_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Loans_Out | FinCM_L_Loan_Out_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Tax | FinCM_L_Tax_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Liq_Out_Sum | FinCM_L_Liq_Out_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_Mut_Intern | FinCM_L_Liq_Saldo_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_RC_End_Calc | FinCM_RC_End_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_RC_End_Saldo | FinCM_RC_Saldo_Plan |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Loans_In_MC | FinCM_L_Loan_In_Plan_MC |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Loans_Out_MC | FinCM_L_Loan_Out_Plan_MC |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Mut_Cred_MC | FinCM_L_Mut_Cred_Real_MC |\\r\\n| FinCM_L_Mut_Deb_MC | FinCM_L_Mut_Deb_Real_MC |\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinCM_UpdateRecord*** has been worked on.

It seems to mostly summarize data from other tables and do simple calculations with these summarized data to fill its fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLGT_UpdateRecord*** has been worked on. There are 3 \'MC\' fields added that are filled from \'FinLeG_Total\'. These fields are then used for some simple calculations.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***FinLGY_UpdateRecord*** has its classic 4D query replaced by an ORDA query.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Medium Labels\\r\\nMethod ***MedPro_PrintLabels*** now has an extra option for company 006. Apparently these labels have to be slightly different from the labels in 001 and 003, 004.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Reg Emp\\r\\nMethod ***TC2E_ExportConceptListOrder*** now has 2 extra columns named \\"Transport temp Stage3\\" and \\"Tranfer Price\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analysis Order Access Trigger\\r\\nThe trigger method of [Analysis_Order] has been modified. There were fields that a regular used could change, but a manager couldn\'t. These fields have been added to the manager group as well. Also, the field \'AnO_amount_Datapoints\' is added to the exception list.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe code is hard to read and it\'s easy to make mistakes. Therefore, an optimized method of declaring exception fields will be implemented next week. This will make it possible to pass in an array of fields, as well as the individual fields to the ***DB_LockFields*** method.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Stuff\\r\\nMethod ***WebApp_Startup*** has received the extra line `WebApp_AddRouting(\\"/api/locations/@\\"; \\"Web_TCLocationsController\\")`. This means a new API routing has been added.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nWhat I find strange is that the method ***Web_TCLocationsController*** is also called in the line before.

Table Forms will be ignored.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Status \'Current\'\\r\\nMany tables have a status that is time based. Meaning that the status can, for example, be either old, current or future. This \'current\' status was often also named \'running\' because it is currently running. However, this is now standardized to \'current\'. Many tables have had this change implemented:\\r\\n- [Clone]\\r\\n- [ComPCropY]\\r\\n- [ComProd_Week]\\r\\n- [ComProd_Year]\\r\\n- [CropWeek]\\r\\n- [CropYear]\\r\\n- [Contact]\\r\\n- [Employee_Month]\\r\\n- [Employee_Week]\\r\\n- [Employee_Year]\\r\\n- [Fin_ExchangeRate]\\r\\n- [FinIGY_InvestmentGroupYear]\\r\\n- [FinLed_Month]\\r\\n- [FinLed_Year]\\r\\n- [FinLeG_Month]\\r\\n- [FinLeG_Year]\\r\\n- [FinTur_ComCrop_Year]\\r\\n- [FinT_MG1_Year]\\r\\n- [FinT_MG2_Year]\\r\\n- [FinTurCom_Year]\\r\\n- [PlantC_Week]\\r\\n- [PlantC_Year]\\r\\n- [PlantMonth]\\r\\n- [PlantYear]\\r\\n- [PlantTotal]\\r\\n- [Project1_Year]\\r\\n- [Project2_Year]\\r\\n- [ProjectGroup_Year]\\r\\n- [Pu_Article_Month]\\r\\n- [Pu_Article_Year]\\r\\n- [TC_Plan_GYear]\\r\\n- [TeamMonth]\\r\\n- [TeamWeek]\\r\\n- [TeamYear]\\r\\n- maybe more that I have missed?\\r\\n\\r\\nThere might be some side effects of changing the status name. These side effects will show in due time, and will be tackled one by one. Every implementation of this change is ignored in the rest of this blog post.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliveries\\r\\nScanning menu for deliveries now also fills the company name in the Delivery Note.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_ExportToTC2EScanning*** now also calls the ***Clo_UpdateRecord*** when creating a new Clone.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** now also searches for delivery items of the same Order and sums up the amount of plants of these delivery items and calculates the difference of this sum with the amount of plants ordered. This should give a better view if the Order has been fulfilled or not.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse-Field\\r\\nObject method has been added to Form \'Scan_Dialog_EnterDeliveryGF\' object \'vScan_Btn_Close5\' that seems to take information from the clipboard and creates Mutation_Employee records for Greenhouse-Fields records.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Complaints\\r\\nMethod ***AL_ExportExcelComplaints*** has been added to export complaints to an Excel file.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Access tabs\\r\\nA new naming standard for tab inter process variables has been introduced and implemented in some of the access methods. Instead of naming the variables `<>kCompanyTab1` and `<>kCompanyTab2` a leading 0 is introduced, making it `<>kCompanyTab01` and `<>kCompanyTab02`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Lab\\r\\n### Analysis Isolation Plate Overview\\r\\nThe plate creation in Analysis Isolation Overview did not always respect the order of the selected samples when putting them into an isolation plate. It seems like the selected (highlighted) entities of the list box would automatically be ordered by record number (not even by ID!). The idea implemented to fix this is to go through the full list box entitySelection (source) with a for loop and check every entity if it\'s in the selected (highlighted) entitySelection (the unordered one) and add it to an ordered entitySelection one by one (as shown below).\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nvar $sample : cs.Analysis_SampleSelection\\r\\n$samples:=ds.Analysis_Sample.newSelection(dk keep ordered)\\r\\nFor each ($sample; Form.samples)\\r\\n\\tIf (Form.selectedSamples.contains($sample))\\r\\n\\t\\t$samples.add($sample)\\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\nEnd for each \\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***AnOv_UpdateWellsNew*** has been changes to keep its order. Apparently, newly made selection using the `.newSelection()` function don\'t keep their order by default when adding entities. Using `.newSelection(dk keep ordered)` will keep the entitySelection order of the entities added to the entitySelection.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThe entitySelection in the list box holding the selected entities seems to be unordered by default. Maybe initializing the entitySelection using the `.newSelection(dk keep ordered)` would prevent this, but this has not been tested yet.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pathogens\\r\\nMethods ***AnSam_CreateUpdate_PathogensTes*** and ***AnSo_CreateUpdate_PathogensToTe*** now have an extra if statement in case a \'duplicate\' pathogen record is present, but one of them has the status \'inactive\'. This is because there are some duplicate pathogen name short in the Pathogen table, but deleting them was not desirable therfore, the status of the duplicates is set to \'inactive\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Clone\\r\\nMethod Clo_UpdateRecord has had a change.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen finding the \'Date In\' of the origin clone, we do a While loop to follow the clone link all the way to the first clone. Instead of using the \'Clo_Date_in\' of this original clone, the \'Date_in_OrigClone\' is used.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nthe full code for finding the \'Date In\' of the origin clone is:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\nFor each ($cloneLink; $cloneLinks)\\r\\n\\t//add all non zero dates to collection\\r\\n\\tIf (Date($cloneLink.originclone.Clo_Date_In)#!00-00-00!)\\r\\n\\t\\t$originDates.push(Date($cloneLink.originclone.Clo_Date_In))\\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\nEnd for each \\r\\n\\t\\r\\nIf (Date:C102($originDates.min())#!00-00-00!)  //safety mechanism to not overwrite manual data when no clone links are present\\r\\n\\t//get the earliest date from all linked origin clones\\r\\n\\t[Clone]Clo_Date_in_OrigClone:=Date($originDates.min())\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\nWe go through all of the clonelinks and save the \'Clo_Date_In\' to a collection. Then we get the first date by taking the lowest date out of that collection and assign it to the \'Clo_Date_in_OrigClone\' field. Why was this changed from taking the \'Clo_Date_In\' to taking the \'Clo_Date_in_OrigClone\' from the origin clone(s)?\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Brazil plants present\\r\\nMethod ***Clo_UpdateRecord_TC2*** has been expanded to get the total amount of plants present in location 006 (Brazil).\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Scanning\\r\\nForm \'Scan_Dialog_Printing\' objects \'vScan_CloneCode2\' and \'vScan_CloneCode2\' and form \'Scan_Dialog_Printing\' object \'vScan_CloneCode2\' now also include the ***Clo_UpdateRecord*** method before saving the new clone.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Company History\\r\\nA new table is added (renamed technically) called [Com_History]. It seems to be a table similar to [Order_History], but then for the Company Table. For now its seems to mostly be prepared to track company code (mc), name and location changes (country, address ect.), when and who made the change.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nSome methods for \'PlaCT\' can probably be deleted or renamed. Take a look at the following methods:\\r\\n- ***PlaCT_Colorfield2***\\r\\n- ***PlaCT_Sum2***\\r\\n- ***PlaCT_UpdateRecord2***\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Documents\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_Updaterecord*** has been adjusted where some Classic 4D queries have been replaced by ORDA queries as well as filling the Crop Code, Crop Name and Cultivar Code Origin.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nLine 42 and 43 of method ***Doc_Updaterecord*** both fill the same field but with different data:\\r\\n```4D\\r\\n$find:=ds.Plant_Code.query(\\"Pla_ID = :1\\"; [Document]Doc_ID_ForeignKey:3)\\r\\n\\tIf ($find.length=1)\\r\\n\\t\\t$find:=$find.first()\\r\\n\\t\\t[Document]Doc_CropCode:=$find.Pla_CropCode_Num\\r\\n\\t\\t[Document]Doc_CropName:=$find.Pla_CropName\\r\\n\\t\\t[Document]Doc_CultCode_Origin:=$find.Pla_CultCode_Origin\\r\\n\\t\\t[Document]Doc_CultCode_Origin:=$find.Pla_PlantCode\\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\nThis means that the `[Document]Doc_CultCode_Origin` will always be filled the the `$find.Pla_PlantCode`.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiment Treatment\\r\\nMethod ***ExT_UpdateRecord*** modified. The classic 4D query has been replaced with an ORDA query. Also, a new query has been added to fill the Cropcode and cultcode origin according to the plantCode.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThe CropCode is also entered in the Experiment, and is now (also?) searched in the Treatment. What is the relation between these fields of these related tables?\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes a treatment **always** have **single** plant_code?\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial\\r\\nMethod ***FinAcDate_UpdateRecord*** has been extended to fill fields related to loans, saldo and their difference.\\r\\n\\r\\nTable [Fin_Liq_Month] has been renamed to [Fin_Com_Month]. The existing fields and methods are renamed to comply to the naming standard. Fin_Com_Month also has about 85 new unnamed fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nTables [Fin_Com_Year] and [Fin_Com_Total] have been added. The new tables also have several new forms and methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n## CropWeek TPP\\r\\nTable [CropWeek] has 4 extra fields (renamed from unnamed fields):\\r\\n1. CroWe_TPP_12M_Real\\r\\n2. CroWe_TPP_12M_Plan\\r\\n3. CroWe_TPP_12M_Model\\r\\n4. CroWe_TPP_12M_Calc\\r\\n\\r\\nTable [ComPCrop_Week] has 4 extra fields\\r\\n1. ComProdW_TPPReal\\r\\n2. ComProdW_TPPPlan\\r\\n3. ComProdW_TPPModel\\r\\n4. ComProdW_TPPCalc\\r\\n\\r\\nThese fields calculate the Transfers per Plant (TPP) of the last 12 Months and have been added to their respective ***UpdateRecord*** methods.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_Check*** has removed (commented out) a section that searches for contact records (lines 781 t/m 784).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_ExportExcel_Flex*** has been modified. It seems like some extra optional fields have been added.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_UpdateRecord*** now searches invoices based on Order IDM to fill the [Order]Ord_N_Plant_Invoiced field.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TCPA\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_ExportActivityListClones*** has been added that exports the TC Planning to Excel.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_SyncExportClones*** has been adjusted to include Macedonia, Ghana, Brazil and Osorno (Company Code 8). The method now also only searches for clones created in the last 7 days, instead of the last 14 days.\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_SyncImportClones*** has also been adjusted to reflect these changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Stuff\\r\\nAction \'refresh\' has been added to method ***Web_DeliveriesController***. Method Web_DeliveriesRefresh has also been added."},{"id":"/2024/05/03/Xiphium-W18-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/05/03/Xiphium-W18-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-05-03-Xiphium-W18-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-03-Xiphium-W18-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W18 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-05-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 3, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":3.7,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W18 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W20 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/05/21/Xiphium-W20-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W17 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/26/Xiphium-W17-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nBecause of the many changes this week, I will only cover changes in methods. I will try to find significant changes object methods (i.e. \'buttons\') but will probably miss some.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crop Year\\r\\nMethod ***CroYe_UpdateRecord*** now also calculates the \'CroYe_Plant_Forecast0\' and \'CroYe_Plant_Open_FC0\'\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliveries\\r\\n### UpdateRecord\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** now also calculates the amount of related Actions related to it. This should only be able to 0 or 1 given the (intended) 1:1 relationship. This number can help with finding delivery items that have actions related to them.\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Optimization strategies</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the above method is a perfectly valid, there is an alternative method that can be considered: \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of doing a query to [Actions] for **every** Delivery_Item **every time** the record is updated, the query could also be done only when looking for Delivery_Items with an [Action]. Sure, the search would become slower, but all of the updates would become quicker.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo depending on the amount of times we expect users to search any Delivery_Items with a related [Action], we can consciously choose one of the 2 methods for optimal performance for our use case.\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n### Go to button\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_ACE*** has been added to go from Delivery_Items to an Action.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial\\r\\nSeveral Field Name changes have been done in several Financial tables.\\r\\n\\r\\n### FinLiM_UpdateRecord\\r\\nMethod ***FinLiM_UpdateRecord*** seems to have many code changes because of these name changes. However, some significant code changes are:\\r\\n- When querying for invoices, `Inv_ComCode_Deb_MC # 1` is added\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Queries and placeholders</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nPlaceholders in queries are a great way to use variables inside of your query safely. However, when using hard coded values, it\'s more readable if they\'re put in the query directly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current\\r\\n```\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice.query(\\"Inv_Date_Invoice >= :1 and Inv_Date_Invoice <= :2 and Inv_ComCode_Deb_MC # :3\\"; $date_LastYear; Current date; 1)\\r\\n```\\r\\nis less clear than:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice.query(\\"Inv_Date_Invoice >= :1 and Inv_Date_Invoice <= :2 and Inv_ComCode_Deb_MC # 1\\"; $date_LastYear; Current date)\\r\\n```\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::danger\\r\\nThere seems to be duplicated code in method ***FinLiM_UpdateRecord*** from line 248 to line 260. Since these lines contain a query (that is now duplicated), it has a significant impact in the performance of this method.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n- a new code block is added for records that have the status \'Realized\'. In this block the fields FinLiM_L_TO_Plan, FinLIM_L_TO_12M_Plan, FinLiM_L_TO_Plan_MC and FinLiM_L_TO_12M_Plan_MC are filled using [FinTurCom_Month] data.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Status query\\r\\nMethod ***FinT_CCM_UpdateRecord*** has been modified. An [Order] query now excludes an extra [Order] status \'GreenHouse\'.\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>not(collection in query)</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\ninstead of repeating the same property/field 3 times, it can be more readable to use the property/field once, and compare it to a collection.\\r\\n\\r\\nso instead of the current:\\r\\n```\\r\\n$orderSel:=$orderSel.query(\\"Ord_CropCode = :1 and Ord_Month_S3 = :2 and Ord_OrderType2 = :3 and Ord_Status # :4 and Ord_Status # :5 and Ord_Status # :6\\"; $CropCode_Text; [FinTur_ComCrop_Month]FinTurCCM_Month; \\"Del@\\"; \\"Can@\\"; \\"Fin@\\"; \\"Green@\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWe could do:\\r\\n```\\r\\n$orderSel:=$orderSel.query(\\"Ord_CropCode = :1 and Ord_Month_S3 = :2 and Ord_OrderType2 = :3 and not(Ord_Status in :4); $CropCode_Text; [FinTur_ComCrop_Month]FinTurCCM_Month;new collection(\\"Del@\\"; \\"Can@\\"; \\"Fin@\\"; \\"Green@\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\nIt\'s a good idea to check if wildcards are still respected. Maybe performance will be better too!\\r\\n \\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same method can be applied to method ***FinT_CCY_UpdateRecord*** line 125.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Price\\r\\nMethod ***PlaPri_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted to keep track of by who and when the record was created and modified.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project2 Year\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted. The order query now ignores the ComCode_Prod. This means that all orders of the same WorkType, Customer and Crop as the Project2_Year will be used for the budget (except cancelled Orders ofcourse).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \'TC budget\' is now automatically filled using the orders. This makes it impossible to manually adjust the amount.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Stuff\\r\\nMethod ***000_TestRL*** had a massive cleanup, leaving only 3 of the 1214 lines intact.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_DeliveriesController*** has been adjusted in response to [ticket #204](https://github.com/Iribov/Xiphium/issues/204).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_DeliveriesGetItem*** has been added.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethods ***Web_GreenhouseLoad*** and ***Web_GreenhouseSave*** have been adjusted to also fill the \'DiT_Q_Medium_Score\' field on the Delivery_Item.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Miscellaneous\\r\\n### Clone Link synchronisation\\r\\nMethods ***TCPA_SyncExportCloneLink*** and ***TCPA_SyncImportCloneLink*** have been added to facilitate the synchronization of the [Clone_Link] records.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Licencing expiration\\r\\nMethods ***A_StartupParameters*** and ***A_StartupParameters_new*** have had their dates adjusted.

I will try to find significant changes object methods (i.e. \'buttons\') but will probably miss some.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Constants\\r\\nNew methods have been added to (more) easily add Constants. Constants are a really nice way of providing a value that is consistent withing the runtime of a database, but is prone to change in different instances. The nice thing about constants is that they can be used in the code, and the value(s) do not live inside of the Data file. **Default_Company** is probably a great example of where a constant could be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly created methods make it easy to create constants in code, instead of creating the constant file(s) manually.\\r\\nThe added methods are:\\r\\n- ***Constants_Add***\\r\\n- ***Constants_AddGroup***\\r\\n- ***Constants_ExportToFile***\\r\\n- ***Constants_New***\\r\\n- ***Constants_Setup***\\r\\n\\r\\n***Constants_ExportToFile*** is added to the ***App_OnStartup*** method, so this method created the constant file(s) when the app is started.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nAs a rule of thumb: Code should rarely use hard coded values. It should use constants instead. These constants should also be well documented to avoid duplication and/or confusion of where they are used and for what.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project2\\r\\n[Project2_Year] has a new input form called \'Greenhouse\'\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_UpdateRecord*** had several adjustments:\\r\\n- Connect to a [Project2] through either an (entered) Project2 IDM, or an entered ProjectCode2_Long. When both are changed at same time, IDM takes the priority. \\r\\n- Calculate both the Cost and Turnover using its ProjectCode2_Long and Year to look for invoices.\\r\\n- If Turnover is bigger than the current budget (budget A), Calculate Saldo (leftover budget) using the turnover instead of the budget.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Project2 Year \'Duplicate\' fields\\r\\n[Project2_Year] contains a lot of fields that are also in table [Project2]. This duplication should be unnecessary because a [Project2_Year] is linked to [Project2]. These duplicated [Project2_Year] fields have replaced by the related [Project2] Fields in both the code and the Forms. The \'duplicate\' [Project2_Year] fields are not deleted (yet!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only place where this might be a problem is in the Project2 Detail forms where you can use the radio button to summon other [Project2_Year] records that are not related to the opened [Project2]. Is this something we\'re supposed to support? And isn\'t that what the [Project2_Year] List form is for?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe changes fields are:\\r\\n- ProjectCode1\\r\\n- ProjectCode2\\r\\n- ComCode_Prod\\r\\n- ComName Prod\\r\\n- ComCode Customer\\r\\n- ComName Customer\\r\\n- CropCode\\r\\n- CropName\\r\\n- WorkType\\r\\n\\r\\n### Project2_Year & Invoices\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_RadioB_InD*** has been added to filter Invoice_Items based on radio buttons in the Invoice tab of the Project2_Year detail form.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Invoices\\r\\nMethod ***InV_UpdateRecord*** has had a lot of code changes. This is mostly replacing classic 4D queries with ORDA queries.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***InD_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted to look for a [Project2_Year] using the ProjectCode1 long Creditor and the invoice year. The method now also auto generates the ProjectCode2 Creditor according to the entered parameters in invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThe ProjectCode2 Creditor is only entered once. If any parameters are changed (comcode credtior, work type, crop, etc.) after running this code once, the projectcode2 long creditor will not change.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Analysis Lab invoices\\r\\nThere was a mistake made in the code that creates invoices form Analysis. The wrong project2 Field was filled with the projectcode2_long. Now, created invoices are able to be found as \'cost analysis\' (if a correct projectcode2 is entered in the [Analysis_Order] before creating the invoice).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Delivery Invoices\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_CreateInvoice_DiT*** has been modified to also copy the comcode Production to the invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Greenhouse-Field invoice\\r\\nMethod ***GF_CreateInvoice_WBP*** has been modified to also copy the comcode Production to the invoice.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Equipment Maintenance\\r\\nMethod ***EqMa_UpdateRecord*** has its status logic improved.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Experiment Scan Menu\\r\\nMethod ***ExT_AddObservationColumns*** has been edited to be able to display more than 1 Treatment listbox in the same form. It now used a generated UUID for the column and header object names to make sure they are unique.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Field\\r\\nMethod ***GF_ExportExcelReportEstimateQC*** now also exports Medium codes of bundled Delivery_Items as well as the \'DiT_Q_Medium_Score\' (if it\'s above 0).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliveries\\r\\nNew input form \'Notes\' is added.\\r\\n\\r\\nDelivery_Items \'tools\' button now has the \'Create Complaint\' option added.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC_Reg_Emp\\r\\nButtons \'Goto Next TC_Reg\' and \'Goto Prev TC_Reg\' have been added. These buttons go to the next/previous \'cycle\' of the TC_Reg_Emp record(s).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThe list Form is getting a little full with \'Goto\' buttons. Maybe a drop-down or a \'Tools\' buttons will be useful here?\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Stuff\\r\\nSome refactoring has been going on: method ***Scanning_UploadDeliveries*** has been renamed to ***Web_Scanning_UploadDeliveries***. \\r\\n\\r\\ncategory \\"delivery-item-experiment\\" has been added tot be added to onedrive in the method ***Web_PhotosSave***"},{"id":"/2024/04/19/Xiphium-W16-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/19/Xiphium-W16-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-04-19-Xiphium-W16-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-19-Xiphium-W16-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W16 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-04-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 19, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":6.55,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W16 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W17 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/26/Xiphium-W17-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W15 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/12/Xiphium-W15-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nIt seems like the lack of changes from last week have been balanced this week...\\r\\n\\r\\nThis weeks Git(Hub) changes have been too many to create a good overview. Therefore, I will ignore all of the Table Form changes (this means all code written directly in objects/buttons or the methods of Table Forms.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n## 000_TestRL\\r\\nMethod ***000_TestRL*** now contains 3 new methods:\\r\\n1. ***Scanning_UploadDeliveries***\\r\\n2. ***WebApp_Startup***\\r\\n3. ***Web_DeliveriesController***\\r\\n## Action List\\r\\nMethod ***AL_UpdateRecord_Val*** has its SQL query code replaced by ORDA. \\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThere is a typo in method ***AL_UpdateRecord_Val*** on line 16: `If ($ACE.lemgth#0)` which should be: `If ($ACE.length#0)`\\r\\n:::\\r\\n## Experiment Scan Menu\\r\\nThe Experiment Scan Menu is still in development, but is now able to do its basic scanning task. The experiment and treatment implementation is still in development.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Changes to essential scanning methods:\\r\\nsmall changes were made to method ***Scanning_CloseScanning*** and ***Scanning_ClosePrinting***. The methods now accept an (extra) boolean parameter to keep the current dialog open. This (should) have no impact on current implementations of the methods since the boolean defaults to False.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Access excel export\\r\\nMethod ***Access_ExcelExportOverview*** has been added to export the user access to excel.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Clone\\r\\n### Excel Flex Export\\r\\nMethod ***Clo_ExportExcel_Flex*** has been extended to include the \'new\' Issue, Issue Remark and Age of the clone.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Invoice_Detail\\r\\nMethods ***InD_UpdateRecord*** and ***InD_UpdateRecord_Val*** have been adjusted. ***InD_UpdateRecord_Val*** has only received a small change, while ***InD_UpdateRecord*** has received some big changes. The intention of these changes seem to mostly changes SQL and classic 4D queries into ORDA.\\r\\n## Crop Year\\r\\nNew tab \\"Locations\\" has been added to the Crop Year access method.\\r\\n\\r\\n9 fields have been renamed from `CroYe_Plant_S3_Loc[company code]` to `CroYe_Plant_S3_[company code]`. example: `CroYe_Plant_S3_Loc001` -> `CroYe_Plant_S3_001`.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***CroYe_Sum*** has been extended to include more fields.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***CroYe_UpdateRecord*** has been extended to fill more Plant Summary fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Company\\r\\n### Filter method\\r\\nMethod ***Com_Filter*** has been added to filter the Company List Form, instead of using the object method of the Filter Button.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Update Val\\r\\nMethod ***Com_UpdateRecord_Val*** has been extended to get all the account manager name(s) from financial turnover Company Crop (total). \\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Code Improvement!</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nThere is a flaw in method ***Com_UpdateRecord_Val*** on lines 41 to 46:\\r\\n```\\r\\nIf ($AccManagers.length=1)\\r\\n\\t[Company]Com_Acc_Man_Names_in_FinTurCCT:=$AccManagers[0]\\r\\n\\tIf ($AccManagers.length>1)\\r\\n\\t\\t[Company]Com_Acc_Man_Names_in_FinTurCCT:=$AccManagers.join(\\" | \\")\\r\\n\\tEnd if \\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\nThe above code could simply be replaced with:\\r\\n```\\r\\n[Company]Com_Acc_Man_Names_in_FinTurCCT:=$AccManagers.join(\\" | \\")\\r\\n```\\r\\nHowever, this will overwrite the field if there are no account managers found in financial turnover. If this is undesired, we could use 1 \'if\' statement to create the following code:\\r\\n```\\r\\nIf ($AccManagers.length>0)\\r\\n\\t[Company]Com_Acc_Man_Names_in_FinTurCCT:=$AccManagers.join(\\" | \\")\\r\\nEnd if \\r\\n```\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nThe `.join()` function will not add the seperator character if only 1 element is in the collection.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n## DeliveryNote\\r\\n### Action (Complaints)\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_Create_Complaint*** has a small addition that adds the Action IDM to the DeliveryNote.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_UpdateRecord*** has been extended to look for Action (complaints)\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nThe newly added code does the same query twice if there is a record found. it would be more time efficient to query only once, and save the result in a variable. This way, you only exchange data with the server once.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Go To Action\\r\\nMethod ***DeN_Goto_ACE*** has been added. This method goes from DeliveryNote to Action via the Action IDM entered in DeliveryNote. This method has been added to the \'Tools\' button.\\r\\n## Delivery Item\\r\\n### Action (complaints)\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Create_Complaint*** has been added. This method creates an Action (complaint) and connects all selected Delivery_Items to this (new) Action (complaint). \\r\\n\\r\\n:::danger\\r\\nIt seems that now it is both possible to connect a [DeliveryNote] AND [Delivery_Items] to an [Action]. It would make more sense from a relational database design perspective to only be able to do 1 of these connections!\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Feedback Excel export\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_ExportDel_Cust_Feedback*** has been adjusted to contain more information. The details are too big to summarize here.\\r\\n\\r\\n### UpdateRecord\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe record now tracks when and by who the record was created, and last edited. It also updates the \'clone is issue\', \'clone issue is incident\' and \'clone issue remarks\' from the clone. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf the amount of plants accepted by the customer (DiT_N_14_Accept_Cust) = 0, then the Accept_Cust is now calculated using:\\r\\n`[Delivery_Items]DiT_N_12_Accept_Good+[Delivery_Items]DiT_N_17_Del_NoInfo` instead of the just `[Delivery_Items]DiT_N_12_Accept_Good`\\r\\n\\r\\n### Go To Buttons\\r\\nAll of Go To methods below has been added to the \'Tools\' button.\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Delivery Items Go to Buttons</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_Clone*** has been added. This method goes from Delivery_Items to their Clone using the \'PlantCloneCode\' entered in the Delivery_Items.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_DeN*** has been added. This method goes from the highlighted Delivery_Items to their related DeliveryNote(s).\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_GF*** has been added. This method goes from the selected Delivery_Items to their related Greenhouse_Field records that contains their Delivery_Items IDM.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_Order*** has been added. This method goes from the selected Delivery_Items to their related [Order] record. It does so by using the Order IDM entered the Delivery_Items.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_Goto_PuArt*** has been added. This method goes from the selected Delivery_Items to their related [Purchase_Acticle]. It does this by using the Article code entered in the Delivery_Items.\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial Turnover\\r\\nMethod ***FinLiM_UpdateRecord*** now takes status into account. Some queries were updated as well\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nCombining multi-line queries to a one-line query using the `AND` or `OR` operator(s) minimizes client/server communication. This optimization might not be as noticeable on LAN, but are more noticeable over WAN.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\nquite some Financial Turnover methods were changes:\\r\\n1. ***FinLiM_ColorField***\\r\\n2. ***FinLiM_RadioB_Inv***\\r\\n3. ***FinLiM_UpdateRecord***\\r\\n4. ***FinTuM_UpdateRecord***\\r\\n5. ***FinTuT_UpdateRecord*** (method has been emptied, but not deleted)\\r\\n6. ***FinTuY_UpdateRecord*** (method has been emptied, but not deleted)\\r\\n\\r\\n## HourRegistration\\r\\nMethod ***HR_UpdateRecord*** has been updated. The WBSO Code us now updated through the new connection(s). This has greatly simplified the code:\\r\\n```\\r\\n//get wbso code via Project2_Year route\\r\\nvar $project2Year : cs.Project2_YearEntity\\r\\n$project2Year:=ds.Project2_Year.query(\\"Pro2Y_IDM = :1\\"; [HourRegistration]HR_IDM_Pro2Y).first()\\r\\n$WBSO_Code:=String($project2Year.ProjectGroup_Year.ProjectGroup.ProGT_ProjectCode)\\r\\n```\\r\\n## Order Group\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_DialogModifyBatch*** has been extended. The method now also updates more parameters when entered in the dialog:\\r\\n1. Company Name Sales (from entered Company Code Sales)\\r\\n2. Company Name Sales2 (from entered Company Code Sales2)\\r\\n3. Status\\r\\n4. Order Type 2\\r\\n5. Order Date\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plant Month\\r\\nMethod ***PlantM_UpdateRecord*** has had some changes. The method now calculates a lot more periods. It seems like the method needs some more work befire being fully functional.\\r\\n## Project2\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2_DialogModifyBatch*** has been added. This method implements the modify batch dialog \'Pro2_Dialog_ModifyBatch\'.\\r\\n### Project2 Month\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2M_UpdateRecord*** has been adjusted. Some SQL queries have been replaced with ORDA. The logic for \'status\' has been moved to the top and status \'current\' has been added. Also, several date periods are calculated, but are not used (yet).\\r\\n## TCPA Excel Flex\\r\\nMethod ***TCPA_Excel_Export_Flex*** has been extended. It seems to be able to add more subtotal(s) now.\\r\\n## Financial Dashboard\\r\\nFinancial Dashboard has a newly filled tab. The new tab is a copy from the \'General Dashboard\' tab \'TC Moving Sum\' and shows the moving sum of transfers of 6 different things (Model, Plan, Real, Model S3, Plan S3 and Real S3).\\r\\n## Web stuff\\r\\nMethod ***Web_DeliveriesController*** has been added. The method seems to authorize a given action based on an API key.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***WebApp_Startup*** has been extended with the new ***Web_DeliveriesController***. The startup method initializes routing for the given webapps.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Simple Export bugfix\\r\\nMethod ***00_Simple_Export*** had a bug where related \'1\' fields gave an error (but still exported just fine). \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter analysing this part of the code, it seems that the method itself is not capable of exporting \'1\' fields more than 1 relation away. In other words, it can only export data directly related to the current table."},{"id":"/2024/04/12/Xiphium-W15-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/12/Xiphium-W15-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-04-12-Xiphium-W15-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-12-Xiphium-W15-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W15 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-04-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 12, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":0.77,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W15 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W16 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/19/Xiphium-W16-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W14 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/04/05/Xiphium-W14-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Cleanup\\r\\nSeveral unused Forms, tabs, Objects and Object methods have been removed.

The file now includes what year is exported in the header data and the main data includes the employee code instead of just the name. The separation of Iribov Analytical Services and Iribov is now also implemented in the export.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Xiphium is now open source\\r\\nThe GitHub repository of Xiphium is now made open source, meaning everyone can access the source code and is licences to use and (help) develop the product.

Now, observations can modified in the experiment while in the menu. The observations are then dynamically added to the treatment listbox using the new method ***ExT_AddObservationsColumns***. The base function (scanning and printing for TC) is not fully functional yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Scan_Dialog_Planning\\r\\nIf the Planning Group is created before **Current Date**, the Company Code production field is no longer editable in this scanning menu.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Items\\r\\nMethod ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** has received an update that the new part from last week that determines the certification. If a delivery is bundled, multiple clones are \'under\' 1 Delivery Item, and the status has to be aggregated in delivery items. The method now skips this step if no clones are found \'under\' the Delivery Item.\\r\\n\\r\\n## General QR Code\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_Show_General_QR_Code*** is added. This method generates a QR code based on the highlighted record. This method is applicable to any record of any table. This method is one of the preparations for a general Photo scanning app.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Employee QR Code\\r\\nMethod ***HR_PrintLabels_QR*** is added to create a QR code for an employee. This will make it easier in different scan menu\'s to log in.\\r\\n\\r\\n## HourRegistration\\r\\nMethod ***HR_UpdateRecord*** has a small change related to the WBSO code. It seems like this code is prone to future changes since the exact (expected) workings are not defined yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n## QR Code labels analytical Lab\\r\\nThe special seperation character \\"|\\" that is used in Analytical QR codes to seperate the Table number from the unique identifiers has been replaces with a whitespace \\" \\". This is due to inconsistencies in the generation/printing of the QR Code. Sometimes the \\"|\\" would get replaced with a \\" \\", but sometimes it was just removed from the QR code, making it unusable.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Project2_Year\\r\\n### Budget\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_UpdateRecord*** has been modified to calculate budgets differently than before. The exact workings were discussed and a new version should be implemented soon.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Radio buttons\\r\\nMethod ***Pro2Y_RadioB_Ord*** is added to centralize the radio button behaviour of the \'Order\' detail screen of Project2_Year.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Duplicated fields\\r\\nSome duplicated fields in Project2_Year could be removed. These fields have been mostly replaced in the code an layout so that the (connected) Project2 variant is used.\\r\\nThese fields are:\\r\\n- Crop Code\\r\\n- Crop Name\\r\\n- Company Code\\r\\n- Company Name\\r\\n- Worktype\\r\\nThese fields should never change over the lifetime of the project, so it is not necessary to store them in Project2_Year.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reference Collection Individual\\r\\nThe Reference Collection QR code layouts can now be printed for Reference Collection Individual with the help of a popup screen with a drop down button.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse App\\r\\nMethod ***Web_PhotosGetCategories*** has been expanded with 2 new categories:\\r\\n1. Reference Collection\\r\\n2. Experiment-Treatments\\r\\n```json\\r\\n$categories.push(New object:C1471(\\"id\\"; \\"Reference-Collection\\"; \\"name\\"; \\"Reference Collection\\"; \\"prefix\\"; \\"\\"))\\r\\n$categories.push(New object:C1471(\\"id\\"; \\"Experiment-Treatments\\"; \\"name\\"; \\"Experiment Treatments TC (TC Reg Emp Barcode)\\"; \\"prefix\\"; \\"\\"))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_PhotosSave*** has also incorporated these 2 new categories.\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC print Labels\\r\\nMethods ***Web_TCPrintDuplicateLabels*** and ***Web_TCPrintLabels*** have been modified to use the ***Scanning_PrintLabelsQR*** method when default company = \'004\'.\\r\\nIn other words: Iribov Ghana will be printing QR code labels for Tissue Culture (as soon as the database there is updated).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crop\\r\\nThe \'Create Record\' button for creating a new (unique) crop has been modified. It should be tested for bugs, and replace the \'add record\' button.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new method ***filterOnDisplayedFields*** is now used in the List form by a searchable field. This is useful for searching a crop name in all 3 crop name fields at once (but other displayed fields will be searched too).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial Turnover\\r\\nThe financial turnover tables have had many modification. Many layout modifications have been done.\\r\\nvarious \'Distribute Turnover\' buttons have been added\\r\\n\'Create Months\' button has been added for Financial Turnover Worktype Year"},{"id":"/2024/03/15/Xiphium-W11-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/15/Xiphium-W11-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-03-15-Xiphium-W11-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-15-Xiphium-W11-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W11 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 15, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":2.345,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W11 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W12 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/22/Xiphium-W12-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W10 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/08/Xiphium-W10-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Experiment Scan Menu\\r\\nThe new scanning menu for tissue culture experiments has been put into the live database.

It\'s too much work/detail to list all changes made (this can be seen on the GitHub), so a short summary is made here. The most notable changes are:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Status\\r\\nThe status for most/all financial turnover tables has been changed to:\\r\\n- Prognosis (month is in the future)\\r\\n- Current (current month)\\r\\n- Realized (month is in the past)\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Financial Turnover WorkType\\r\\nThe Financial Turnover WorkType tables \'Month\' and \'Year\' have received some attention. The Update Record methods have been added and/or updated to get some data from other places.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Plants Code\\r\\n\'remarks commercial\' is now a searchable filed in Plant Code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Items\\r\\nPart of method ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** has been rewritten. The rewritten part tried to get information from the [Clone] table using the plantCloneCode entered in the delivery item. \\r\\nBundled deliveries sometimes have multiple clones bundled, so a delivery_item can\'t have a plantCloneCode entered.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new version of the method takes this into account, and searches the [Delivery_Scanning] for plantCloneCodes and aggregates the results in Delivery_Items.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Miscellaneous\\r\\nProtocol Component has been removed from the Analysis menu.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \'DisplayCode\' field in analysis sample can now be edited even after the analysis order is \'locked\'. \'DisplayCode\' is only used for the [Clone] table, so this has no effect on the Analysis Results whatsoever.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***filterOnDisplayedFields*** has been added. This method can filter a \'classic\' form using a text input, and searching all fields displayed in the current tab of the List Form. Finding all records that have a value in a displayed field that (partially) matches the text input.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***Web_PhotosGetCategories*** now has a new category: \\r\\n```{\\"id\\": \\"delivery-item-experiment\\", \\"name\\": \\"Delivery item experiment GF\\", \\"prefix\\": \\"Experiment\\"}```. Its seems to be preparation for pictures taken in the greenhouse that have to be linked back to a TC Experiment.\\r\\n\\r\\nButton \'vScan_Btn_Close7\' has been added to the Delivery Note detail form. The button contains code that \'Imports Feedback Form info into records from the clipboard (tab delimited text)\'."},{"id":"/2024/03/08/Xiphium-W10-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/08/Xiphium-W10-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-03-08-Xiphium-W10-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-08-Xiphium-W10-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W10 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-03-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 8, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":1.78,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W10 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W11 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/15/Xiphium-W11-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W09 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/03/01/Xiphium-W09-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Cost calculation\\r\\nThe \'General_CostCalculation\' form has received some extra fields. It seems like the fields are there for extra parameters, but it\'s hard to interpret a form change just from code.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***CosCal_Calc*** has received changes to a few calculations in regards to \'space\' calculations? The intentions of these changes are unclear form just reading the code, but the changes seem significant.\\r\\n\\r\\nMethod ***CosCal_GetParameters_B4*** has some changes in calculating process variables that are used in ***CosCal_Calc***. It seems like the changes in ***CosCal_Calc*** are done to accommodate the changes done in ***CosCal_GetParameters_B4***. It is unclear if the changes in code result in practical changes, but it does seem to indicate so.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse app\\r\\nMethod ***Web_PhotosGetSubjectInfo*** has added the Greenhouse Field \'barcode\' to an object, indicating that the information sent from/to the app now includes this barcode.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Items \\r\\n### Account Manager Name\\r\\nA button is added that updates the account manager responsible and creates an excel with missing Company-Crop combinations. If no Company-Crop record is found, the name is taken from Company, and the Company-Crop combination is exported to Excel.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Incident registration\\r\\nA boolean Field has been added to register if a delivery item is an \'Incident\'. An incident is not an issue yet, but it is also not well defined.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Lab\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reference Collection Individual\\r\\nThe reference Collection individual label has been improved. Unfortunately, the wish of printing a different label, depending on which tab has been selected in Reference Collection, does not seem possible.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Locked fields\\r\\nIn the analytical part, certain fields become locked based on the status. The field \'Remarks_Invoice\' is added to these locked fields.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Fin_Liq_Month\\r\\nSeveral small changes have been done in different places for the [Fin_Liq_Month] table.

The method creates an email containing the \'scores\' of highlighted Delivery Items and sends it to info@iribov.com. The method can be used by a new button in the DiT_List form.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Field Name changes\\r\\nSome Delivery_Items fields have had a name change:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Old Name               | New Name                       |\\r\\n| --------               | --------                       |\\r\\n| DiT_SalesLoc_Q_Remarks | DiT_SalesLoc_Issue_Remarks     |\\r\\n| Field_220              | DiT_SalesLoc_Is_Issue          | \\r\\n| Field_221              | DiT_SalesLoc_Issue_Is_Incident |\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems like these name changes have something to do with tracking issues on a delivery Items level.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial turnover\\r\\nSome minor changes in method ***FinT_CCY_UpdateRecord*** where field names containing \'FinTurCCY_ASP_Real\' are changed to \'FinTurCCY_ASP_Total\'. The implication of this change is unknown form just reading the code, but it looks like refactoring (just changing the names, without functionally changing anything).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe forms for several financial turnover tables have been adjusted. Some name changes in fields, but mostly adding \'invisible\' button for sorting  and adding/adjusting the filter button.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Field Name Changes\\r\\nSome Financial Turnover fields have had a name change:\\r\\n\\r\\n| Old Name                       | New Name                   |\\r\\n| ---                            | ---                        |\\r\\n| FinTurCCY_ASP_Real             | FinTurCCY_ASP_Total        |\\r\\n| FinTurCCY_ASP_Real_Order       |  FinTurCCY_ASP_Total_Order |\\r\\n| FinTurCCY_ASP_Real_Order_Prev1 | FinTurCCY_ASP_Prev1_Order  |\\r\\n| Field_158                      | FinTurCCY_ZZZ              |\\r\\n| Field_159                      | FinTurCCY_Perc_GF          | \\r\\n| Field_160                      | FinTurCCY_Perc_S3          | \\r\\n| Field_161                      | FinTurCCY_ASP_S3_Prev1     | \\r\\n| Field_162                      | FinTurCCY_ASP_S4_Prev1     |\\r\\n\\r\\nThe idea behind these name changes in unclear without knowing the context.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse \\r\\n\\r\\n### Greenhouse Planning Action\\r\\nThe week M2 Excel Export has been enhanced in the second tab (temperatures). Now, all Planning actions that have been assigned to a sepcific space (through Space IDM) are excluded from the temperature aggregations. Below the temperature aggregations are now the Space aggregations. This makes the second tab of the export the \'Temperatures and Spaces\' table.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Greenhouse app\\r\\nMethod ***Web_GreenhouseSave*** has some changes, indicating an improvement in the Greenhouse App. What these changes improve exactly is unclear without understanding the context.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order History\\r\\nMethod ***Ord_History_Export*** is added to mimic the excel Eloy used to make manually. The method accepts  an Order_History Selection (ORDA) and outputs an Excel with a single tab. In this tab, it is tracked in what week there are changes done to the order. What the changes amount to (in amount of plants), and who initiated the changes (total or client changes). \\r\\n\\r\\n## Tissue Culture\\r\\n\\r\\n### TCPA Synchronisation\\r\\nChanges have been made to methods ***TCPA_SyncExportTCPlanActions*** and ***TCPA_SyncExportTCPlanActionsN_1*** to include the field \'TCPA_BF_Finished\' in the synchronisation.\\r\\n\\r\\n### TC App\\r\\nMethods ***Web_TCGetJarsBack*** and ***Web_TCSaveJarsBack*** both have some changes, indicating changes made into the TC app. The funcitonality of these changes are unclear without knowing the context.\\r\\n\\r\\n### TCPC filter button\\r\\nThe filter button in the TCPC_List form has been modified to correct (what seems like) a logic mistake in the filtering of records.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Purchase Article Month (PuartM)\\r\\nSome invisible buttons (used for sorting) have been modified in the \'list\' and \'subform\' form, but for some reason they contain fields for the [FinTur_ComCrop_Year] table. Is that correct?\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical Lab\\r\\n### Reference Collection Individual\\r\\nReference Collection individual continues to get improvements as bugs are being found by using the new system.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Iribov Brazil\\r\\nIribov Brazil is continued to be integrated into the system. This week, \'HR_WeekEntry\' is modified to include comcode 004 in a certain check related to (Team) Manager stuff.

The name of the method suggests it export Delivery Items and compares the \'Percentage rooting\' with the \'Percentage accepted\'. This method used to be an object method (code directly written in a button), but has been moved to this newly created method.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe dialog popup for exporting to Excel has been extended.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \'CrossCode\' is now copied from Greenhouse Field over to Delivery Items. This should help Breeding with keeping track of their crosses that are not (yet) \'declared\' as PlantCodes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Planning Actions\\r\\nMethod ***GHPA_Excel_Export*** has been added. The method exports the square meters planned per week. This is done in 2 tabs (2 different views).\\r\\n1. Per Crop\\r\\n2.

It is not clear if these methods are in use yet.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Crop\\r\\nA \'Create Record\' Button has been added to the Crop List. The \'Add Record\' button is still available for now, but should be removed over time.\\r\\nPeople quite often add a blank record, and don\'t modify it.

This is done by searching Invoice_Items on their \'ProjectCode2 Debitor\' field (and some other parameters of course). These costs are then divided into 3 categories:\\r\\n1. Analytical (when creditor is company code 12)\\r\\n2. Greenhouse (when creditor is company code 5)\\r\\n3. Other\\r\\n:::note\\r\\nInternal invoices for Analytical has been done for multiple years. However, internal invoicing for the Greenhouse is not a thing yet. The code is already implemented, but won\'t get any data until internal invoicing for Greenhouse is realized.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analytical lab\\r\\nmultiple changes are realized this week in regards to the \'Analysis\' module.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Project2 code from Analysis to Invoice items\\r\\nProjectCode2 Debitor and creditor are now filled automatically when creating an invoice from an Analysis Order. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe fields \'ProjectCode2 Creditor\' and \'ProjectCode2 Debitor\' from the Analysis Order are copied into the \'ProjectCode2 Creditor\' and \'ProjectCode2 Debitor\' fields of the Invoice Items.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Analysis Order and SubOrder\\r\\nSome fields are both entered in the Analysis Order, and Analysis Suborder. And because the different analysis suborders can contain different values for 1 field, and the analysis order typically can only hold 1 value; there\'s a mismatch.\\r\\n\\r\\nTherefore, for the following fields it is still possible to enter in the Analysis_Order upon creation, but as soon as suborders are created (with a value in the field), these values will overwrite the Analysis_Order value. When different values are entered in the different suborder, these values will be concatenated in the Analysis Order.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis applies to fields:\\r\\n- Crop Code\\r\\n- Crops (Crop Name Scientific)\\r\\n- Type Objective\\r\\n- Type Material (Type tissue)\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info Example\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Example with Crop</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\nIf You create an Analysis Order, you can only enter 1 Crop.\\r\\nLet\'s say you use Brassica.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut in reality, the client sends both Brassica and Iris. Instead of splitting this into 2 order, it\'s possible to create 2 suborders: 1 with crop \'Brassica\', and 1 with crop \'Iris\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem, however, is when you look at the Analysis Order it only says \'Brassica\'. This is the mismatch we solved with this update.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, because we have 2 suborders (\'Brassica\' and \'Iris\'), the analysis Orders is updated to say \'Brassica, Iris\'. So now, when you look at the order, it mentions both crops. When you\'re searching for either \'Brassica\' or \'Iris\', the order always comes up.\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n### Analysis Genotyping\\r\\nA new Excel file for importing has been created by the analytical lab. The import button is now updated and started implemented.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Reference Collection individual\\r\\nA scanning system for tracking individual tubes of a \'Reference Collection\' has been developed and exposed this week. Testing for bugs is still necessary and will start next week.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Clone\\r\\nModify Batch now takes the field Clo_CB_Clock into consideration. When a clone already has this \'blocked\' property, the fields that track \'who\' and \'when\' blocked this record will not be overwritten.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Field\\r\\nGreenhouse Field now contains a field called \'GF_Analysis_Clean\'.\\r\\nThis field copies the \'Clo_AnSam_Result_0_Clean\' field from [Clone] to indicate whether the clone was tested \'Clean\' by the analytical lab.\\r\\nThe field also changes color depending on the contents of that field (Green when clean, red when not clean, etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\n## TCPA SEE (Certification)\\r\\nThere are fields added to the form and filter regarding SEE (certification).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery items\\r\\nThe article code field in Delivery Items is now searchable."},{"id":"/2024/02/09/Xiphium-W06-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/02/09/Xiphium-W06-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-02-09-Xiphium-W06-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-09-Xiphium-W06-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W06 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 9, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":3.005,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W06 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W07 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/02/16/Xiphium-W07-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W05 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/02/02/Xiphium-W05-Update"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse \\r\\n### Scanning Menu Sorting\\r\\nThe greenhouse scanning menu for sorting continues to get incremental improvements. The changes are small and the intentions are unclear from the code alone, but there is work being done to improve the experience of the scanning menu.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Excel Flex Export\\r\\nWork is being done on the Excel Flex Export for the Greenhouse. When the new export will be ready for testing/use is unclear from just reading the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Iribov Brazil\\r\\nIribov Brazil is continued to be integrated into the system. This week the integration is in the Tissue culture scanning menu, specifically the \'printing\' menu for printing QR/barcodes for tissue culture.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery\\r\\nThere have been several changes in different parts related to deliveries:\\r\\n\\r\\n### Delivery and Planning Actions\\r\\na small change to method ***DeN_ExportToTC2E_Scanning*** is done. a new \'If, Else\' statement is introduced to a query for Planning Actions. If the delivery_item has a \'Scan_Week_Realized\', that week is used to search for planning actions. Otherwise, the week set in the DeliveryNote is used.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Unbundling\\r\\nA small addition to the method ***DeSca_UnBundleSelection*** is done. The method now also copies the \'Scan_Type_Box\' from Delivery_Scanning to the Delivery_Item when \'unbundling\' bundled deliveries.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Customer Feedback Excel Export\\r\\nWork is being done on the Customer Feedback Excel Export. When the export is ready for testing/use is unclear from just reading the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n### OneDrive Photo sharing\\r\\nSome code has been added to the ***DiT_UpdateRecord*** method to shield Iribov Brazil off from the OneDrive photo sharing system. Probably with the intention of adding Iribov Brazil in later.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Web Document\\r\\nMethod ***Doc_AddDocument*** has received additional error catching. It seems like a method that can add a document to a record from the web (apps). It is now coded in that a file must have a filename when uploading, and returns an error if it doesn\'t.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Backup Info\\r\\nThe method that informs us if a Xiphium backup had any trouble has been updated. The information message now includes the \'DefaultCompany\' Code (which database had trouble with the backup?).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::info\\r\\nThe \'DefaultCompany\' Code is the company code of where the Xiphium Database is running. The Xiphium Database in NL has \'DefaultCompany\' Code \'001\', Macedonia \'003\' etc.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n## TC Planning Actions (TCPA)\\r\\nSmall change made to the UpdateRecord methods. If a TCPA has Activity \\"DT@\\" (@ is a wildcard than can be anything), the TCPA no also needs a ComCode Production to receive the \'DefaultCompany\' Code as its \'ComCode Master\'.  \\r\\nIt seems like this change is done in regards to synchronizing  \\"DT\\" Action between locations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order\\r\\n2 buttons have been added.\\r\\n1. \'Create TCPA delivery actions\'\\r\\n2. \'Fill TCPC IDM via TCPA T4 Ord IDM\'\\r\\n\\r\\nThese buttons have been added in regards to a request to make it easier to create TC Plan Actions for a large(r) amount of Orders at once, and to close the \'triangle\' of Order, TCPC and TCPA. I believe these button are added as a test. If/When they are to be used by others in the \'regular\' workflow, is unclear from just reading the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n### TC Planning Action (TCPA)\\r\\nButton \'Fill OrderIDM T4 via Week Root in Order\' has been added to the TCPA List Form. This button is supposed to close the \'Triange\' of Order, TCPC and TCPA. The intended usage in the workflow are unclear from just reading the code."},{"id":"/2024/02/02/Xiphium-W05-Update","metadata":{"permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/02/02/Xiphium-W05-Update","editUrl":"https://github.com/Iribov/xiphium-documentation/edit/main/blog/2024-02-02-Xiphium-W05-Update/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-02-Xiphium-W05-Update/index.md","title":"Xiphium 2024-W05 update","description":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).","date":"2024-02-02T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 2, 2024","tags":[],"readingTime":2.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Jim Kerver","title":"4D Developer @Iribov","url":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver","imageURL":"https://github.com/Jim-Kerver.png","key":"jim"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W05 update","authors":["jim"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W06 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/02/09/Xiphium-W06-Update"},"nextItem":{"title":"Xiphium 2024-W04 update","permalink":"/xiphium-documentation/blog/2024/01/26/Xiphium-W04-Update/Index"}},"content":"Here is the weekly update of (significant) changes made in Xiphium this week, extracted from Git(Hub).\\r\\n\\r\\n:::warning\\r\\nThese are interpretations of code read from the weekly changes from Git(Hub) and are therefore prone to errors.\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n## Reference Collection Individual\\r\\nThe backend of reference collection individual (tracking individual reference collection \'tubes\') is now in place. The frontend of this feature will be implemented in the next week(s).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Iribov Brazil\\r\\nCompany Code 006 (Iribov Brazil) is continued to be integrated into the system. This week, the DeliveryNote code generator now takes creditor 006 into account when creating a DeliveryNote (using format YYCNNNN where YY = Year, C = ComCode Creditor, N = sequential number).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Delivery Bundling\\r\\nThere are changes made to the code that facilitates bundling of Delivery_Items. There now seems to be a \'protection\' or \'guard clause\' to enforce a rule with the alert: \'*This Delivery Note should not be bundled, because the new location production needs to have the barcodes*\'. There are more changes to this code, but the intentions of the changes are unlear from just reading the code.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Add document error handling\\r\\nIf there is an error when adding a document, method \'WebApp_Error\' is now called to build the $return parameter, instead of building the $return parameter in 3 seperate lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Financial Month (liquidity)\\r\\nFinancial month continues to be developed. The focus is now mostly on modifying the forms and update method to comply to current vision for the table.\\r\\n\\r\\n:::tip\\r\\nThe queries in method FinLem_UpdateRecord can be optimized to reduce server calls, as discussed in the 4D lesson \'Take care of the queries\' @47:00 minutes (watching the whole lesson is recommended though). Although this optimization may not be noticeable when working close to the server, it will be noticeable when further away form the server (say, connected with a VPN from home).\\r\\n:::\\r\\n\\r\\n<details>\\r\\n<summary>Query optimization(s)</summary>\\r\\n\\r\\n**Optimization example:**\\r\\n\\r\\ncurrent code:\\r\\n```4d\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice.query(\\"Inv_Date_Invoice <= :1\\"; $date_M_Fist)\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice1.query(\\"Inv_Date_Payment > :1 or Inv_Date_Payment = :2\\"; $date_M_Fist; !00-00-00!)\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice1.query(\\"Inv_Date_Closed > :1 or Inv_Date_Closed = :2\\"; $date_M_Fist; !00-00-00!)\\r\\n[Fin_Liq_Month]FinLiM_Deb_Open:=$invoice1.sum(\\"Inv_Amount_SC_Inc_Tax\\")\\r\\n```\\r\\nThese 3 server calls can be reduced to a single server call using brackets inside of the query:\\r\\n\\r\\n```4d\\r\\n$invoice1:=$invoice.query(\\"Inv_Date_Invoice <= :1 and (Inv_Date_Payment > :1 or Inv_Date_Payment = :2) and (Inv_Date_Closed > :1 or Inv_Date_Closed = :2)\\";$date_M_Fist;!00-00-00!)\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis minimizes communication between the server and the client, optimizing both speed (server only needs to do 1 query instead of 3) and network chatter (server only sends data to client once instead of 3 times).\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\n## Order Synchronization\\r\\nThe line: ```QUERY SELECTION([Order]; [Order]Ord_no_sync_to_WBP=False)``` was added to method \'***Ord_SyncExportOrdersWBPtoFTP***\'. What this means is unclear to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Greenhouse Sorting scan menu\\r\\nSafety is added to the method ***Scanning_CloseSortingGF***. This means that a password is now needed to finish sorting in the scan menu.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Analysis Invoice creation\\r\\nBoth methods for creating invoices (from suborders and from samples) have a slight change logic so that the discount is taken from the year present in the OrderCode, and not from the year of Date_Entry.
