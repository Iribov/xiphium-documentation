## Purpose

An **R&D** [Order](Order.md) initiates a research or experimental process in the tissue culture lab. These orders are used to track internal or client-driven research activities, when plant material is produced as part of the study or development effort.

## The Bigger Picture

R&D (Research and Development) in a tissue culture context can cover a wide range of activities â€” from protocol optimization to viability testing of new species or genotypes. While the scope is often exploratory, these orders are still tightly tracked in the system because they often involve:
- Creation of plant material
- Experimental material that must be documented
- Deliverables to clients or internal reports

Unlike production orders, R&D Orders are not necessarily repeatable or scalable. Their goal is to **gain insights or test new approaches**, often generating valuable learning for both the client and internal teams.
## Core Fields
- Client Code
- Work Type
- Order Type 2 = 'R&D'
- Week Prognose
- Amount Prognose:
- Production Company
- Plant Code

## Common Usage
- Used to initiate and track experiments involving tissue culture
- Supports internal innovation projects and client-specific studies
- May result in plant material being grown, tested, or even delivered if applicable
- Often used in early phases before a new protocol or plant is added to standard production
