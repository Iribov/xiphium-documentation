## Purpose
The initiation [Order](Order.md) is meant for new (in vivo) plant material that need to be introduced in tissue culture (in vitro). 

## The bigger picture
Initiation is the first [stage](../../General/Stages.md) of Tissue Culture. The practical work is highly specialized and intricate and prone to failure.

## Core Fields
- Client Code
- Work Type
- Order Type 2 = 'Initiation'
- Week Prognose
- Amount Prognose = 0 (should be kept empty, because the amount of plants is not important)
- Production Company
- Plant Code

## Common Usage
Whenever a new plant (or clone) has to be introduced into tissue culture, an initiation order has to be made. It is possible to re-initiate a plant (due to failure of initiation or the need of fresh material), but this should always become a new Clone. 

## Caveats
The rules for re-initiations are not well defined or well followed. It is now a rule that if you want to 're-'initiate the same plant, it should become a new Plant_Code (except when previous initiation has failed). However, this rule is not enforced in the system.
