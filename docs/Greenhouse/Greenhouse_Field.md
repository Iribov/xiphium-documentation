# Greenhouse Field
Greenhouse Field is a table in which plants planted in the greenhouse are tracked. The detailed tracking is mostly done in [Mutations](Mutations.md) with the help of a scanning menu, and are summarized in greenhouse field. But some data is directly entered in greenhouse field.

Only plants that are (or have been) in the greenhouse get a greenhouse field record.
