Protocol1 is the first translation layer of translating an [Order](../../Tissue_Culture/Order.md) into a Greenhouse Planning **automatically**. Protocol1 contains the steps necessary to grow the plants in the greenhouse. These steps are the [Protocol Lines](Prot_Lines.md).

The steps on how to get from an [Order](../../Tissue_Culture/Order.md) to a planning is explained in the [introduction](Introduction.md).
