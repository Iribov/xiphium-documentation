# Greenhouse Planning Action (GHPA)

Table containing the planning of the greenhouse. A planning is made per [order](../../Tissue_Culture/Order.md). If plants from different orders are planted together in [Greenhouse Field](Greenhouse_Field.md), the planning is still maintained per order. Production numbers syncronized from [Greenhouse Field](Greenhouse_Field.md) will be split to the planning action in ratio of the amount of plants in their related [order](../../Tissue_Culture/Order.md).
