# Crop
The Crop table is a collection of Plant/Crop names. Every Plant/Crop gets a unique semi-sequential number/code that is used throughout the database to refer to this Plant/Crop. This is generally called the 'CropCode'.

Over the years, this table has been used for other organisms than just plants. Therefore, the field 'Organism' was introduced. In this field, you can specify other groups of organisms (such as, Yeast, Bacteria, Algae, Etc.).

Although a 'Crop' can generally also be called a 'Plant', it should not be confused with the [Plant Code](PlantCode.md).
