# Project Group
A Project Group is an umbrella for multiple projects. Within Iribov NL this table is strictly used to register WBSO projects.

A [Project2](Project2.md) can be connected to a Project Group per Year. This is done by connecting the [Project2 Year](Project2Year.md) to [Project Group Year](ProjectGroupYear.md) throught IDM (the practical way of connecting is likely to change in the future, but will always rely on IDM).
