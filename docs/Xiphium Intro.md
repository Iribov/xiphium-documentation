Xiphium is an [ERP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) created in-house by [Iribov](www.iribov.com). It is not commercially available. This documentation helps Iribov employees to navigate this vast program as we continue to develop more features.

## 4D
Xiphium is built on the [4D platform](https://us.4d.com/). 4D offers a fast and easy development experience, all in the same environment. This does mean that Xiphium is bound to the limits of the 4D platform.

## Modules of Xiphium
Altough Xipihum is not a modular program, we can define different parts of it as 'modules' just to get an idea of what the program is capable of.

### Tissue Culture
The heart of the program and the main reason Xiphium exists, is the tissue culture module. In this module you can plan and track tissue culture production.
### Logistics
Logistics is special in that it has a section dealing with receiving/delivering tissue culture plants and a section dealing with receiving/sending other items.
#### Tissue Culture Plants
In the logistics of delivering tissue culture plants, feedback about the quality is a nice addition to the regular tracking of you deliveries. This section is connected/interwoven in the Tissue Culture module.

#### Other items
Sending/Receiving other items than tissue culture plants is a separate section that has nothing to do with the tissue culture module. It has its own Orders, Items and stock.
### Greenhouse
The greenhouse can be seen as a separate module, but is heavily interwoven with the Tissue Culture module. Plants in the greenhouse often come from tissue culture, and the delivery of them is traced in the same table as tissue culture plants. It might be better to see the Greenhouse module as an 'expansion' of the tissue culture module, where not all tissue culture plants have to follow this expanded route.

### Medium
Tissue Culture plants need to grow in something. This medium can be bought, or produced in house. The medium module provides a place to define your media as well as a rich tracking system of its production.

### Breeding
The breeding is made for tracking crosses and their results. The result of a successful breeding project (that usually contains many crosses) can be a tissue culture plant that can then be used in the tissue culture module.

### Analytical
The analytical module is a place where analytical lab test results can be registered. This is mostly optimized for tracking Pathogen tests results but can also be used for other kinds of tests like plo√Ødy and genetic marker tests.

### Human Resources
The human resources  module is a place to register employees, their information (personal details, salary, contract, etc.) and to track their hours.
### Financial
The financial module has invoices as their base table. These are then summarized in multiple summary tables to get a good overview of what is going on on different levels. Futhermore there is an investment section as well as a ledger section.
### Project Management
Project management is where a lot of modules come together to be able to see the progress of a project. The definition of a project is very wide, and goes from production of a certain crop, to a project that is only temporarily worked on.
