# TC Planning Cycle
A Tissue Culture Planning Cycle (TCPC) is a record that contains data of a specific Cycle of a [TC Planning Group](TCPG.md). The TCPC can be used to create [TCPAs](TCPA.md). It can also be a more convenient overview of the planning, compared to [TCPA](TCPA.md).

There is much more information tracked in a TCPC record, which should be described when this documentation gets more attention.
