Tissue Culture planning always begins with an [Order](Order.md) and a [TC Planning Group (TCPG)](TCPG.md). 

## Order
An [Order](Order.md) (follow link for more details) should not be confused with the general definition of an order. Usually, an order is a client asking "I would like x amount of product y". But because of the inherent complexity in Tissue Culture planning/production, we need to know when the client needs the plants. That way, we can 'reverse calculate' when we should start production to achieve the amount of plants ordered. Therefore, the 'week request' is used (the week of when the client requested to receive the plants). After making the planning, we can enter our planned week of delivery in 'week prognose' and the probably possible amount of plants to deliver in 'plants prognose'.

This is the basis of an order. You can see that the delivery week is in the Order too. For this reason, whenever a client  wants to distribute their deliveries (say, 1000 plants in week 20, and 1000 plants in week 25), we need to create 2 Order records.
