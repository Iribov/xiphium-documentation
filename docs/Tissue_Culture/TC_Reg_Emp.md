# TC Registration Employee
The Tissue Culture Registration per Employee (TC Reg Emp) registers everything done to (a batch of) tissue culture plants. Whenever an employee uses the scanning system for tissue culture, a TC Reg Emp record is either added or modified. Modifications to a TC Reg Emp record are recorded in the [Mutations_Employee](Mutations_Employee.md) table.

There is much more data the TC Reg Emp registers, which should be described when this documentation gets more attention.
