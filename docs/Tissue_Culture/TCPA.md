# TC Planning Actions
A TC Planning Action (TCPA) describes a planned action to be performed in tissue culture. Actions are describes by their Activity, the amount of plants, and what week the action should be performed.

A TCPA is always connected to a [TC Planning Group](TCPG.md), and can be connected to a [TC Planning Cycle](TCPC.md).

There is much more information tracked in a TCPA record, which should be described when this documentation gets more attention.

## Activity
the activity of an action is often displayed by its acronym (2-3 letter). These actions, their acronyms and their description can be found in the [Choice List] with the Choicelist name 'Activity'.
