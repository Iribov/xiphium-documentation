# Mutations Employee
Mutations made to the [Tissue Culture Registration Employee](TC_Reg_Emp.md) (TC Reg Emp) record are recorded here. This includes cutting plants to be used in a new TC Reg Emp record. The mutations employee registers both from what TC Reg Emp the plantlets came from, to which TC Reg Emp the plantlets went to. This creates a traceable lineage of where plants in Tissue Culture come from.

There is much more data the mutations employee registers, which should be described when this documentation gets more attention.
