# Analysis Lysis
Analysis Lysis represents an individual lysis from anÂ [Analysis_Sample](Analysis_Sample.md). When a sample is prepared again, this would be a different Analysis Lysis. Analysis Lyses are usually put in a 96 well plate. When a Lysis record is put into a [Analysis Lysis Plate](Analysis_Lysis_Plate.md), in the background only a connection is made by storing the Lysis Plate Name in the Lysis record. Additionally, the position of the lysis in the lysis plate is stored in the lysis record.

The use of Analysis Lysis is mostly to facilitate a connection between [Analysis_Sample](Analysis_Sample.md), [Analysis_Isolation](Analysis_Isolation.md) and [Analysis_DataPoint](Analysis_DataPoint.md) but is also very useful for planning Lysis Plate layouts.

Analysis Lysis makes it possible to do multiple analyses on a sample, and keep track of the results.
