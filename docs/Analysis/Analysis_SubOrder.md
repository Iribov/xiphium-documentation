Analysis sub-order is used as a sub total of [Analysis_Sample](Analysis_Sample.md). An [Analysis_Order](Analysis_Order.md) should always contain at least 1 sub_order.  

Sub-Orders can be created on a whim and samples can be grouped by your liking however, these are the suggested guidelines: 

Sub-Order groups: 

1. Different Crops 
    
    - If an order contains multiple crops, it can be useful to split these samples into different Sub-Order 
        
2. Different Type of Test 
    
    - When some samples need a different test than other, splitting them into groups can help with the processing of data. 
        
3. Different (combination(s) of) pathogens to test
