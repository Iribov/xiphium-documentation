# Analysis Isolation
Analysis_Isolation represents an individual isolation from an [Analysis Lysis](Analysis_Lysis.md). When a lysis is isolated again, this would be a different Analysis_Isolation. Analysis_Isolations are usually put in a 96 well plate. This is tracked in the [Analysis_Isolation_Plate](Analysis_Isolation_Plate.md) table. 

The use of Analysis_Isolation is mostly to facilitate a connection between [Analysis_Sample](Analysis_Sample.md) and [Analysis_DataPoint](Analysis_DataPoint.md) (together with [Analysis_Lysis](Analysis_Lysis.md)) but is also very useful for planning Isolation_Plate layouts.

Analysis_Isolation makes it possible to do multiple analyses on a sample, and keep track of the results.
