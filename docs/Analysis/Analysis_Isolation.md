Analysis_Isolation represents an individual isolation from an [Analysis_Sample](Analysis_Sample.md). When a sample is isolated again, this would be a different Analysis_Isolation. Analysis_Isolations are usually put in a 96 well plate. This is tracked in the [Analysis_Isolation_Plate](Analysis_Isolation_Plate.md) table.
