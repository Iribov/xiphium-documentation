# Analysis Isolation Plate
Analysis_Isolation Plate is the plate (layout) used for isolation, made using the [Analysis Overview](Analysis_Overview.md) screen. The Analysis Isolation Plate record itself only contains basic information about the plate. The actual plate layout is stored in the [Analysis Isolation](Analysis_Isolation.md) records.

The idea is that you can put an [Analysis Sample](Analysis_Sample.md) into an Analysis Isolation Plate, this creates a new [Analysis Isolation](Analysis_Isolation.md) linked to both the [Analysis Sample](Analysis_Sample.md) and Analysis Isolation Plate.
