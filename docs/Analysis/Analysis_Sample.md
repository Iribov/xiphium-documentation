Analysis_Samples are the individual (leaf) samples present in an [Analysis_Order](Analysis_Order.md). These samples are grouped together in an [Analysis_SubOrder](Analysis_SubOrder.md)

**Mixed Samples** 
On rare occassions, a client can have grouped/mixed samples that need to be tracked/reported indidually. In that case, mixed samples can be used (still in devlopment).
