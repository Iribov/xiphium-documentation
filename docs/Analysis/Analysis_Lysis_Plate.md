# Analysis Lysis Plate
Analysis Lysis Plate is the plate (layout) used for lysis, made using the [Analysis Overview](Analysis_Overview.md) screen. The Analysis Lysis Plate record itself only contains basic information about the plate. The actual plate layout is stored in the [Analysis Lysis](Analysis_Lysis.md) records.

The idea is that you can put an [Analysis Sample](Analysis_Sample.md) into an Analysis Lysis Plate, this creates a new [Analysis Lysis](Analysis_Lysis.md) linked to both the [Analysis Sample](Analysis_Sample.md) and Analysis Lysis Plate.
