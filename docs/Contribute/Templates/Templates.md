In an effort to try to standardize the documentation, every page should follow the template for its type. We currently have the following templates:
- [Conceptual Page Template](./Conceptual%20Page%20Template.md) For explaining big ideas or workflows, without tying to one table or screen.
- [Module Overview Template](./Module%20Overview%20Template.md).  Describes the purpose and high-level function of a set of related tables or a subsystem.
- [Entity Template](./Entity%20Template.md). To describe the function of a **table**, **screen**, or anything that represents a single piece of the system.
