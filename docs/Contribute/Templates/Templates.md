In an effort to try to standardize the documentation, every page should follow the template for its type. We currently have the following templates:
- **Conceptual Page Template.** For explaining big ideas or workflows, without tying to one table or screen.
- **Module Overview Template**. Describes the purpose and high-level function of a set of related tables or a subsystem.
- **Entity Template**. To describe the function of a **table**, **screen**, or anything that represents a single piece of the system.
