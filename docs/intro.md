# Xiphium Documentation Intro

## Contributing
The Xiphium documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
This development tool allows us to create a website using only [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents. This allows for everyone to contribute to this documentation website, you only have to learn some basic markdown syntax.

To quickly learn how to write markdown documents, go to [Markdown Intro](Markdown_intro.md)

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are used for version controlling the documentation. We understand that this not an easy tool to learn. Therefore, any created/adjusted markdown files can be sent/put (in)to (will we do an email link or server location or something?). You are also very welcome to learn Git and Github ðŸ˜Š.

## Documentation
For now, this Xiphium documentation is meant more as an overview of the working of Xiphium and less of a 'manual' on how to use it. This is partially due to the changing nature of Xiphium, and the effort it takes to document things on such a detailed level. We could create a more detailed documentation in the future according to the following step by step plan:

1. **Clarify the structure and general workings and ideas of Xiphium and its modules and tables.** 
2. Focus on how they intereact and affect each other. 
3. Focus on manuals and guides on a detailed level. (where to enter what, what buttons to press etc.).
