# Xiphium Documentation Intro
The Xiphium documentation site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).
This development tool allows us to create a website using only [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents. This allows for everyone to contribute to this documentation website, you only have to learn some basic markdown syntax.

To quickly learn how to write markdown documents, go to [Markdown Intro](Markdown_intro.md)

Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) is used for version controlling the documentation. We understand that this not an easy tool to learn. Therefore, any created/adjusted markdown files can be sent/put (in)to (will we do an email link or server location or something?). You are also very welcome to learn Git and Github ðŸ˜Š.
