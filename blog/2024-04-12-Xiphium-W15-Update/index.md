## Cleanup
Several unused Forms, tabs, Objects and Object methods have been removed. This cleans up the directory and forms for a clearer view.

## Clone Series
Changes have been made to 'Button2' in form 'Pla_Dialog_Clones'. When creating a clone series using this button, the delivery note and originType are now added to the new Clone as well. Also, it used to be when creating new CloneCodes without specifying an Origin clone, the new CloneCodes were prefixed with a useless "-". This is now fixed.
